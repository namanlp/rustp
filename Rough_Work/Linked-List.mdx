# Linked List
and built in methods for Linked List in standard crate in Rust

## Introduction

Linked List is an efficient way of storing the data, especially for implementing the Abstract Data Types (ADT) like Stack and Queue.

**Definition :** Linked List is a linear chain like data structure, in which each node contains the address or the pointer of the next node.

Linked List is **non-contiguous**, that is, in the linked lists, data is not stored in sequential memory addresses, unlike Arrays or Vectors.

Linked List can be classified in two ways

### Previous Pointer

In this, we can classify Linked List in two ways

1. **Singly Linked List :** In this, each node contains the address of the next node only. Hence, it is not possible to get the address or pointer of the next node easily, and hence, only **forward traversal** is possible.
2. **Doubly Linked List :** In this, each node contains the address of the previous as well as the next node. Hence, both **forward and backward traversal** is possible.

### Ending

1. **Null Terminated :** In this, the last element of the linked list is pointing to *NULL* or it is a NULL Pointer. As we know that in Rust, Null pointer is not allowed for memory safety. Hence Option:None is used instead.
2. **Circular Linked List :** In this, the last element of the list is pointing  towards the first element, forming a Circular Linked List. Hence, traversing this list may make an *infinite loop* if not handled carefully.

The Linked Lists have a special property:
Insertion as well as deletion can be done in constant time complexity, from anywhere from the array.
This is because of the facts that all you have to do is update the next pointer.

Hence,
Linked List is the best Data Structure
to implement Queue as ADT.


Linked list has one more special property : it can grow without any copying like we did in vectors. So, we can easily use Linked List when we need growable storage.

Hence, Linked List a popular choice for handling collisions in Hash Tables as well as storing adjacent nodes in a graph.
Because in both cases, we have to traverse the entire list anyway.
