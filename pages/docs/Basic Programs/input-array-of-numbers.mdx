# Function to Array of numbers
For Competitive Programming and more in Rust

## Introduction

For many applications, including Competitive Programming, it is generally necessary to take an array of space separated numbers from a user.

So, it is better to make a function and just call it instead of rewriting it again and again. It should be **included in your template**, if you are doing Competitive Programming in Rust.


## What are we doing

In Rust, and most other programming languages, **input is taken as string of characters**.
