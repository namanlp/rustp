# Function to Input a single number
For Competitive Programming in Rust

## Introduction

In Competitive Programming, it is generally the very first step to take a number as an input **and store it as a number** for multiple operations, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc.

So, it is better to make a function and just call it instead of rewriting it again and again. It should be **included in your template**

## What are we doing

In Rust, and most other programming languages, **input is taken as string of characters**. So, it is necessary to convert the string into desired numerical data type like **`i8, u8 , i16, u16, isize, usize, f32, f64`** etc.

**Note :** In this program, we will assume that **integers are in different lines** and only 1 integer per line is allowed. For multiple integers in a single line, see [Function to Input array of numbers](/basic-programs/input-array-of-numbers/)

## Simple Multiplication Program

So, let's start with designing a multiplication program. In this program, we will take two integers and output will be the product of two numbers.

**Example :** <br />
**Input :**
> 23 <br />
34

**Expected Output :**
> 782

### 1. Declaring function

As you might already know, functions are declared in rust using **`fn`** keyword. Also, our function should return the input number. So, our function should look like

```rust
fn take_int() -> usize {
 // Function body here
}
```

You can replace `usize` with any data type you want, provide it can be parsed.

### 2. Declaring a string

Now, we need a string that is used to store the input. Let us name it `input` itself

```rust
let mut input = String::new();
```

### 3. Reading into the string

Now,  to obtain user input, we need to bring the **`io`** input/output library into scope. This is present in standard library, called **`std`**

```rust
use std::io;
```

Now, we read and store input in **`input`** string  we created earlier.

``` rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut input)
    .unwrap();
```
**`unwrap()`** specifies that program will panic if, somehow, string cannot be read

### 4. Converting String into a number

Now, we finally convert the string input to number and return the value.

``` rust
return input
    .trim()
    .parse()
    .unwrap();
```

**`.trim()`** is used to trim any leading or trailing whitespaces. <br />
**`.parse()`** is used to convert the string to number. Interestingly, you don't have to tell the data type in this case, because Rust automatically determines it using return data type. Cool, no? <br />
**`unwrap()`** specifies that program will panic if, string can not be converted to number. For example if you input `12h`, `23 34` it will panic because it is not convertible to number. You must enter 1 number per line.

### 5. Putting things together

```rust
use std::io;

fn take_int() -> usize {
    // Declare string
    let mut input = String::new();

    // Input string
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();

    // Return number
    return input.trim().parse().unwrap();
}
```

### 6. Program With driver code

```rust

use std::io;

fn take_int() -> usize {
    // Declare string
    let mut input = String::new();

    // Input string
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();

    // Return number
    return input.trim().parse().unwrap();
}

// Driver code

pub fn main() {
    let number1 = take_int();
    let number2 = take_int();
    println!("{}", number1 * number2);
}
```

**Input :**
> 23 <br />
34

**Output :**
> 782

## Conclusion

In this article, we designed a function that takes input from user and returns a number in any desired numerical data type. Here is the function

```rust
use std::io;

fn take_int() -> usize {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    return input.trim().parse().unwrap();
}
```

**Note :** We can change the data type of number returned by replacing **`usize`** in above function with desired data type.

We also designed a basic multiplication program, which takes input from user and output the product of these 2 numbers.

In next article, we will discuss how to **Input an array of numbers** in Rust, which is more tricky, but is often required in competitive programming.
