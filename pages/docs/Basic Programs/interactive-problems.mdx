# Solve Interactive Problems in Rust
specifically for Competitive Programming in Rust

## Introduction to Interactive problems

In programming contests, there can be a special type of problem called Interactive Problem. In this problem, input is not predetermined. Rather, it is generated based on the output. Basically, your program "asks" the online judge the "questions"
Online judge "answers" the questions, based on which, your program generates the answer.

These problems are generally like  *guessing games*.

Also, guesses are limited, off course, else the problems will be too easy.
