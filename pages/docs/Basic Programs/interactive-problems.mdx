# Solve Interactive Problems in Rust
specifically for Competitive Programming in Rust

## Introduction to Interactive problems

In competitive programming contests, there can be a special type of problem called Interactive Problem. In these problems, the input is not predetermined. Rather, it is generated based on the *queries*. Basically, your program "sends" the "queries" and the
Online judge "answers" these queries, based on which, your program generates the final answer.

These problems are generally like  *guessing games*.

And, queries are limited, off course, else the problems will be too easy.

## The `flush` Issue

Actually, the output to terminal is an *expensive* process for any programming language. So, most of the modern programming languages make use of Buffer to store the output, and print the output later.
But in the interactive problems, this is a major issue, because online judge will keep waiting indefinitely for the output, as it is stored in Buffer.

So, we have to clear the buffer and print the output. This is called *flushing*.

## `flush` in Rust

From [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.print.html),

*... stdout is frequently line-buffered by default ...*

So, if you use **`println!()`**, your output will automatically be printed as soon as you call it.

Actually there are mainly 2 macros in Rust used for output, `println!()` and `print!()`.

As you might already know, the `println!()` macro ends with newline whereas the `print!()` does not. So, after each `println!()` statement, the buffer should automatically be cleared and output should be shown.
But if you are using `print!()` statement, you must flush the output after each output statement.

For flushing the output, you first have to import using
```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
```
And then, use
```rust
io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
```

to flush.

## Demonstrating Buffer

For demonstrating the buffer, we make a simple program. In this, we first use `println!()` , to show that it immediately flushes the output after each call.

Then we add some `print!()` statements and sleep statements, so that we wait some time. As the output is stored in buffer, it is not printed till we flush the output.

```rust
use std::{thread, time};
use std::io::{self, Write};

fn main() {
    // Define one_second as 1 second of time
    let one_second = time::Duration::from_secs(1);

    // println!() output will be flushed immediately
    println!("This is using println");

    // Now, demonstrating buffered output

    // This is stored in buffer
    print!("This ");
    // This basically sleeps for 1 second
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("is ");
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("not ");
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("flushed ");
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("yet.");
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("\nFlushed now.....");

    // Flushing output
    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();


    print!("\nHence ");
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("the ");
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("buffer ");
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("contains ");
    thread::sleep(one_second);

    print!("the string ");
    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
}
```
