# Function to convert String to Vector of characters
and frequently used string functions for competitive programming and more in Rust

## Introduction

For many applications, especially for many questions in competitive programming, ability to treat string like a vector or array of characters becomes immensely important.
In many questions, you have to take input as a string and then perform certain operations on it like a vector.

In many languages like C, C++, python etc. you can easily index strings using square brackets [], just like vectors or arrays.

In Rust, however, you can not index strings using square brackets. For example, the given code

```rust
println!("{}", string1[0]);
```

will give error

```js
error[E0277]: the type `str` cannot be indexed by `{integer}`
```

or

```js
error[E0277]: the type `str` cannot be indexed by `usize`
```

These operations are used very frequently in various applications, including competitive programming.

So, if you are doing competitive programming in Rust, you should include a function in your template to take string as input, and return vector of chars, for easy access.
