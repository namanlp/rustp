# What is Rust?
Introducing Rust Programming Language


## From Wikipedia
Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish-brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the catalytic presence of water or air moisture :D

## Rust Programming Language
Kidding apart, certainly we will not be talking about this rust here. We will be talking about **Rust Programming Language** here.

Rust is a modern general purpose High Level Programming language, used by many companies and organizations that you might not have imagined, like **NPM, Cloudflare, Atlassian, System76, Canonical** and so on for many applications.

- Rust uses **compiler** instead of interpreter.
- Rust is Open Source
