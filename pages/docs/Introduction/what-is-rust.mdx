# What is Rust?
Introducing Rust Programming Language


## From Wikipedia
Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish-brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the catalytic presence of water or air moisture :D

## Rust Programming Language
Kidding apart, certainly we will not be talking about this rust here. We will be talking about **Rust Programming Language** here.

Rust is a modern general purpose High Level Programming language, used by many companies and organizations that you might not have imagined, like **NPM, Cloudflare, Atlassian, System76, Canonical** and so on for many applications.

- Rust uses **compiler** instead of interpreter.
- Rust is Open Source
- Rust uses concept of **Ownership and Borrowing**
- Rust has a very [good documentation to learn from](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)

## Main Features of Rust

**1. Rust ensures memory safety :** Rust ensures that there are no null pointers, dangling pointers, or data races, unlike C / C++. Moreover, you can not access elements outside of array in Rust.

**2. Very efficient :** Rust is much more efficient in most cases as compared to Java and Python. Its speed is comparable to C++

**3. No Garbage Collector :** As used in other programming languages like Java, rust do not use garbage collector to free the memory. Instead, it uses the concept of *Ownership and Borrowing*. This makes rust much efficient.

**4. Use of Pointers :** Rust also allow the use of Pointers and References. It is unique that Rust allows use of pointers and ensures memory safety at the same time.

**5. Strong community support :** Rust is an Open Source Project and has a [strong, welcoming and active community](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

That's main features of rust for me, but there are many more features. I can not cover all of them here.

## Conclusion

This article introduces Rust Programming Language for a newbie point of view, and covers the main features of Rust.
