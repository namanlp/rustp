# Modular Exponentiation in Rust
And its Program in Rust

## What is Modular Exponentiation

Many times, we have to compute exponents of a given number for various purposes. But it is notable that overflow may occur for large values. Largest number that we can store with numerical data type in rust is **`2¹²⁸`**, and is 2<sup>64</sup> in C / C++.

Now, suppose, in some question, we have to find **`2¹⁰⁰⁰`** modulo 1000000007. If we try to first compute **`2¹⁰⁰⁰`** and then find modulo, rust will throw overflow error.

```python
thread 'main' panicked at 'attempt to multiply with overflow', src/iterative.rs:10:9
```

## Problem statement

Given three numbers n, x and p, compute n<sup>x</sup>  modulo p.

## Naive Approach

Simplest solution to this would be to take 1, and multiply it with n, x times, and find modulo p each time. From [Modular Multiplication](/number-theory/modular-multiplication/#2-multiplication-property), we already know that

<center> <b>(a x b) mod m = ((a mod m) x (b mod m)) mod m</b> </center>

But this will be done in **O( x )** or **Linear time complexity.**

Here's the code for this approach

```rust
fn modular_exponent(n:i128 , x:i128 , p:i128) -> i128{
    // Initialize ans = 1
    let mut ans = 1;

    // Multiply ans with n, x times, ans modulo
    for _ in 0..x {
        ans *= n;
        ans%=p;
    }

    // Return ans
    return ans;
}
```

With Driver Code

```rust
fn modular_exponent(n:i128 , x:i128 , p:i128) -> i128{
    // Initialize ans = 1
    let mut ans = 1;

    // Multiply ans with n, x times, ans modulo
    for _ in 0..x {
        ans *= n;
        ans%=p;
    }

    // Return ans
    return ans;
}

// Driver Code

use std::io;

fn take_int() -> i128 {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    return input.trim().parse().unwrap();
}

fn main() {
    let n = take_int();
    let x = take_int();
    let p = take_int();

    println!("{}", modular_exponent(n, x, p));
}
```

**Input**
>2 <br />
100000 <br />
1000000007 <br />

**Output**
>607723520

**Time Complexity : O( x )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**
<br />
<br />

##  Efficient Divide and Conquer solution

We can find the modular exponentiation in logarithmic time complexity, using  Divide and Conqueror approach.

### Approach

We know that mathematically,

<center> <b> n<sup>a.b</sup> = (n<sup>a</sup> )<sup> b </sup> </b> </center>

So, let's suppose we have to find n<sup>x</sup> and x = 2.y, so, we can find ( n <sup> 2 </sup> ) <sup> y </sup>. <br /> **In y + 1 steps or x/2 + 1 steps**

<center> <b> n<sup>2.y</sup> = (n<sup>2</sup> )<sup> y </sup> </b> </center>
Hence, we multiply n by itself, if x is even.

If, on the other hand, x is odd number **it is guaranteed that x-1 will be even number**, hence, we multiply answer by n, if x is odd, and reduce x by 1.
<hr/>

### Algorithm

1. If x <= 0, return 1.
2. If x is 1, return (answer * n) % p
3. If x  > 1 and even, change n to n<sup>2</sup>, change x to x/2, and go to step 2
4. If X > 1 and odd, multiply answer by n and store answer modulo p, and reduce x to x-1 and go to step 2.

## Program for Modular Exponentiation in Rust

Implementation of above algorithm is written below

```rust

fn modular_exponent(mut n:i128 ,mut x:i128 , p:i128) -> i128{
    // Initialize ans = 1
    let mut ans = 1;

    // x is 0, return 1
    if x<=0 {
        return 1;
    }

    // use loop statement in rust for infinite loop
    loop {
        // Step 2. If x is 1, return (answer * n) % p
        if x==1 {
            return (ans * n) % p;
        }

        // Step 3. If x > 1 and even, change n to n^2, change x to x/2, and go to step 2

        // for checking if x is even, we check the LSB. is 0 or 1
        // Alternatively, we can also check x%2, but this is more efficient
        if x&1==0 {
            n=( n * n ) % p;
            x>>=1; // or x = x/2
            continue;
        }

        // Step 4. If X > 1 and odd, multiply answer by n and store answer modulo p,
        // and reduce x to x-1 and go to step 2.
        else {
            ans = (ans*n) % p;
            x-=1;
        }
    }
}
```

**Input**
>2 <br />
100000 <br />
1000000007 <br />

**Output**
>607723520

**Time Complexity : O( log <sub> 2 </sub> x)** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**

## Conclusion

Modular exponentiation is very frequently used concept in competitive programming for computing the answer.
In this article, we made a program for modular exponentiation in rust in logarithmic time complexity instead of linear time complexity using Divide and Conquer approach. Here's the function for easy access

```rust

fn modular_exponent(mut n:i128 ,mut x:i128 , p:i128) -> i128{
    let mut ans = 1;
    if x<=0 { return 1; }
    loop {
        if x==1 { return (ans * n) % p; }
        if x&1==0 {
            n=( n * n ) % p;
            x>>=1;
            continue;
        }
        else {
            ans = (ans*n) % p;
            x-=1;
        }
    }
}
```
