# Modular Multiplicative Inverse in Rust
And program in Rust to find it using Fermat's little theorem

## What is Modular Multiplicative Inverse

As we know that there is **no divide operation in Modular Arithmetic**. So, Modular Multiplicative Inverse is a number that *replaces* divide function  in Modular Arithmetic.
Modular Multiplicative Inverse of **n** with respect to **p** is a natural number **between 1 and p-1**, let us say x, such that

<center> <b> ( n × x )  mod p = 1 </b> </center>

We can alternatively say that Modular Multiplicative Inverse is a number such that **( n × x ) - 1 is divisible by p**.

x can also be written as **x = ( n<sup>-1</sup> ) mod p**

**For Example :** Modular Multiplicative Inverse of 23 with respect to 10 is 7. ( Because 23 × 7 = 161 and 161 % 10 = 1 )

<hr />

**Note :** The multiplicative inverse of  **n** with respect to **p** exists if and only if **n and p are co prime numbers**

**Proof :** Let us suppose n = q × p + r , where q is quotient and r is remainder. So, if n is divisible by gcd, and p is divisible by gcd, then r must be divisible by gcd too. ( From Euclidean Algorithm )

Hence, if gcd > 1, then remainder must also be greater than 1.

## Need of Modular Multiplicative Inverse

1. For returning or printing fractional numbers in competitive programming. For example, we have to find ( p / q ) mod m. It is simply written as (p × q<sup>-1</sup>) mod m or ( (p mod) ×  (q<sup>-1</sup>) mod m ) mod m,
where **( q<sup>-1</sup> ) mod m** is Modular Multiplicative Inverse of q with respect to m.

2. To find Permutation and Combination of very large numbers. For example, we have to find <sup>100</sup>P<sub>50</sub>. We must first [generate factorial array](/number-theory/factorial-of-mutiple-numbers/),
then compute Modular Multiplicative Inverse of 50! with respect to given number, and multiply it with 100! mod p, and then compute answer. We will discuss detailed method later.
