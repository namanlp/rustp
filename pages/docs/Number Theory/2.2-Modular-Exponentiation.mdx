# Modular Exponentiation in Rust
And its Program in Rust

## What is Modular Exponentiation

Many times, we have to compute exponents of a given number. But it is notable that overflow may occur for large values. Largest number that we can store with numerical data type in rust is **`2¹²⁸`**

Now, suppose, in some question, we have to find **`2¹⁰⁰⁰`** modulo 1000000007. This is called Modular Exponentiation.
