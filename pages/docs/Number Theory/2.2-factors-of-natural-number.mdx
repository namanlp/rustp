# Factors of a Natural Number
And a program in Rust to list all the factors of a natural number

## What are Factors of a number

Factors or divisors of a natural number, say n, is a natural number, say m, that **perfectly divides** the number n. That is, **n % m = 0**. It can also be written that **n = km**, where k is also a natural number.

**For Example :** 1, 2, and 4 are factors of 4, but 3 is not a factor of 4

import factorsOf100 from "../../../images/Number Theory/factors-of-number.webp"

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}} >
    <img src={factorsOf100} width="100%" alt="Factors of 100" />
</div>

## Naive Approach

Naive or brute force approach is to traverse all the numbers from 1 to n, and add the number to vector if it divides the given number. Function for this approach in Rust is :

```rust
fn list_factors(number:i128) -> Vec<i128>{
    // Initialize factors Vector
    let mut factors : Vec<i128> = Vec::new();

    // Check all the numbers from 1 to n, both inclusive
    for i in 1..(number+1) {
        if number % i == 0 {
            // Push the number to factors, if it divides number
            factors.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Return the factors Vector as answer
    return factors;
}
```

Program with driver code

```rust
use std::io;

fn list_factors(number:i128) -> Vec<i128>{
    // Initialize factors Vector
    let mut factors : Vec<i128> = Vec::new();

    // Check all the numbers from 1 to n, both inclusive
    for i in 1..(number+1) {
        if number % i == 0 {
            // Push the number to factors, if it divides number
            factors.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Return the factors Vector as answer
    return factors;
}

// Driver Code

fn main() {
    // Read and parse number to i128
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let number : i128 = input.trim().parse().unwrap();

    println!("{:?}", list_factors(number));
}
```

**Input**

>100

**Output**

> [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100]


**Time Complexity : O(n)** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( sqrt(n) )**

**Note :** We can print the number instead of storing into the array or vector, to reduce **Space Complexity to O(1)** but it is rarely useful. Vector of factors is far more useful in real applications, so I will demonstrate Vector, instead of printing directly.

## Efficient Approach

If you look the condition for factor carefully, that is

<center> <b> n = k.m </b> </center>

So, both k and m are factors of n, and not only m. So, **all the factors of number are in pair**

For example, factors of 100 are ( 1, 100 ), ( 2, 50 ), ( 4, 25 ), ( 5, 20 ) and ( 10, 10 ). Clearly,**If m is a factor of n, n/m is also a factor of n**

Using this property, we only have to check for numbers till square root of n, because it can't be possible to get n, as a product of 2 numbers greater than square root of n.

Function for this approach :

```rust
fn list_factors(number:i128) -> Vec<i128>{
    // Initialize factors Vector
    let mut factors : Vec<i128> = Vec::new();

    let mut i : i128 = 1;

    // Check till i is less than or equal to square root n
    while i*i <= number{
        if number % i == 0 {
            factors.push(i);

            // to prevent duplication, if number is perfect square
            if i*i != number {
                factors.push(number / i);
            }
        }
        i+=1;
    }

    // It is generally useful to sort the vector
    // And it will not affect our time complexity,
    // Because logarithmic time is much less than square root time complexity

    factors.sort();

    // Return the factors Vector as answer
    return factors;
}
```

Use the same driver code.

**Input**

>100

**Output**

> [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100]


**Time Complexity : O( sqrt(n) )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( sqrt(n) )**

**Note :** Repeating, We can print the number instead of storing into the array or vector, to reduce **Space Complexity to O(1)** but it is rarely useful. Vector of factors is far more useful in real applications, so I will demonstrate Vector, instead of printing directly.

## Conclusion

Factors or divisors of a natural number are the numbers that perfectly divides it. In this article we made a program to list all the factors of a natural number in Rust, and also optimized it to square root time complexity. Here is the optimized function for easy access

```rust
fn list_factors(number:i128) -> Vec<i128>{
    let mut factors : Vec<i128> = Vec::new();
    let mut i : i128 = 1;
    while i*i <= number{
        if number % i == 0 {
            factors.push(i);
            if i*i != number { factors.push(number / i); }
        }
        i+=1;
    }
    factors.sort();
    return factors;
}
```
