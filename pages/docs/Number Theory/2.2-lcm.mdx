# Least Common Multiple
and program in Rust to calculate it using Euclidean algorithm.

## What is Least Common Multiple ( LCM )

Least Common Multiple of two natural numbers is the smallest natural number that is divisible by both the numbers.

Lowest Common denominator is used for rational numbers, and it is LCM of denominators of both numbers.

**For Example :** LCM of 100 and 75 is 300

import gcdHcf from "../../../images/Number Theory/gcd-or-hcf.webp"

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}} >
    <img src={gcdHcf} width="100%" alt="GCD of 150 and 210 is 30" />
</div>

## Naive Approach

Let us suppose we have to find Least Common Multiple ( LCM ) of 2 numbers, a and b.

The naive or brute force approach would be to traverse all the numbers from max(a, b) to a × b and find if it is divisible by both a and b. If yes, print the number and return.

We will not write its code, because it is very clumsy.


**Time Complexity : O( a × b )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**
