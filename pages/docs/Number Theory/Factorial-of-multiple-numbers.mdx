# Factorial Of Multiple Numbers
Using Dynamic Programming

## Program without  Dynamic Programming

In the previous article, we discussed how to [find factorial of a number](/number-theory/factorial-of-number/) and how to [find factorial of very large numbers using Modular Arithmetic.](/number-theory/factorial-of-large-numbers/)

As we have already seen in these article, the **Time Complexity for calculating the factorial of each number is O( n )**
So, if we find the factorial of m numbers, clearly the time complexity will be **O( m × n )** , where n is the largest number among m numbers.

Now, let's see a code to demonstrate this. We will use the Iterative function used in [find factorial of very large numbers using Modular Arithmetic.](/number-theory/factorial-of-large-numbers/)

Program

```rust
use std::io::stdin;

fn factorial(number : i128, divisor: i128) -> i128 {
    let mut factorial: i128 = 1;
    for i in 1..(number + 1) {
        factorial *= i;
        factorial %= divisor;
    }
    return factorial;
}

pub fn main() {
    println!("Enter array : ");

    // Read Array of Integers
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let arr: Vec<i128> = input.trim().split_whitespace().map(|x| x.parse().unwrap()).collect();

    // For all number in array, find and print factorial, modulo 1000000007
    // You can replace 1000000007 with any number you like
    // Also, I am using borrowing, so that we can reuse the array again later

    for number in &arr {
        let factorial = factorial(*number, 1000000007);
        println!("Factorial of {} is : {}", number,  factorial);
    }
}
```
**Output**

>Enter array : <br />
12 13 14 15 16 <br />
Factorial of 12 is : 479001600 <br />
Factorial of 13 is : 227020758 <br />
Factorial of 14 is : 178290591 <br />
Factorial of 15 is : 674358851 <br />
Factorial of 16 is : 789741546

**Time Complexity : O( m×n )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O(1)**

## Overlapping Sub-problems

In the above example, we are calculating the factorial of array [12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

For this, we are first calculating 12!, then again 12! and multiply it with 13, to get 13!, then again calculate 13! and multiply with 14 to get 14! and so on. It is depicted by picture below
