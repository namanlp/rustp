# Factorial Of Multiple Numbers
Using Dynamic Programming

In the previous article, we discussed how to [find factorial of a number](/number-theory/factorial-of-number/) and how to [find factorial of very large numbers using Modular Arithmetic.](/number-theory/factorial-of-large-numbers/)

As we have already seen in these article, **The Time Complexity for calculating the factorial of each number is O( n )**
So, if we find the factorial of m numbers, clearly the time complexity will be **O( m Ã— n )** , where n is the largest number.

Now, let's see a code to demonstrate this. We will use the Iterative function used in [find factorial of very large numbers using Modular Arithmetic.](/number-theory/factorial-of-large-numbers/)
