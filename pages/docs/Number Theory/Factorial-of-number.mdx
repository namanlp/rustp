# Factorial Of A Number
And Program in Rust to find the factorial of a number

## What is Factorial of a number?
Factorial of a whole number is defined as the product of all natural numbers from 1 to the number itself, both inclusive.
For example, factorial of **5** would be

5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = **120**

It is denoted using symbol exclamation mark, i.e., '!'. So, **5! = 120**. or 120 is factorial of 5.

Interestingly, factorial of 0 is 1 or **0! = 1**

Factorials of number upto 15 are

| Number | Factorial     |     |     |
|--------|---------------|-----|-----|
| 0      | 1             |
| 1      | 1             |
| 2      | 2             |
| 3      | 6             |
| 4      | 24            |
| 5      | 120           |
| 6      | 720           |
| 7      | 5040          |
| 8      | 40320         |
| 9      | 362880        |
| 10     | 3628800       |
| 11     | 39916800      |
| 12     | 479001600     |
| 13     | 6227020800    |
| 14     | 87178291200   |
| 15     | 1307674368000 |

As you can see, factorial of a number grows very fast. For example,
**40! = 8.15×10⁴⁷ , which is so large that no numerical data structure in rust can store this value.**

Before discussing how to store it, let's see some properties of factorial

## Properties of Factorial of a number

There are just 2 main properties of factorial used in programming

**1. n! = n × (n-1)!**

For example, 5! = 5 × 4! = 5 × 24 = 120

**2. n! = (n+1)! / (n+1)**

For example, 5! = 6! / 6 = 720/6 = 120

## Iterative Approach

**Note :** We will take maximum integer data type in rust, that is `i128` so that we can find factorial of the largest number possible to store

It is the simplest method, just take the number, and multiply it with all the natural numbers less than it.

```rust
fn factorial(number : i128) -> i128{

    // initialize factorial to 1, explicitly type i128
    let mut factorial : i128 = 1;

    // Multiply factorial by all numbers from 1 to the given number
    for i in 1..(number+1) {
        factorial*=i;
    }

    // Return factorial
    return factorial
}
```

Program with Driver Code
```rust
use std::io::stdin;

fn factorial(number : i128) -> i128{

    // initialize factorial to 1, explicitly type i128
    let mut factorial : i128 = 1;

    // Multiply factorial by all numbers from 1 to the given number
    for i in 1..(number+1) {
        factorial*=i;
    }

    // Return factorial
    return factorial
}

// Driver Code

pub fn main() {
    // Read and parse number to i128
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let number : i128 = input.trim().parse().unwrap();

    // Find and print factorial
    let factorial = factorial(number);
    println!("Factorial of {} is : {}", number,  factorial);
}
```

**Output**

>20 <br/>
Factorial of 20 is : 2432902008176640000


**Time Complexity : O(n)** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O(1)**


## Recursive Approach

In this, we compute the factorial using property of factorial **n! = n × (n-1)!** 

So, we find the factorial of n by computing the factorial of n-1 recursively. Factorial of 0 and 1 are 1, as already known. Program is

```rust
fn factorial_recursive(number : i128) -> i128{

    // Base Case
    if number<=1 {
        return 1;
    }

    // Recursive Case
    return number * factorial_recursive(number-1);
}
```
**Output**

>20 <br/>
Factorial of 20 is : 2432902008176640000


**Time Complexity : O(n)** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O(n)**

( Space complexity is O(n) because all the intermediate are stored in stack memory till factorial of n-1 is found. )

**Note :** Iterative approach is more efficient than recursive approach !

## Conclusion

This article covers the basic definition factorial, properties and simple functions to find factorial of a number in Rust in both Iterative and Recursive manner. 

Factorial of Larger Numbers and array will be covered in the coming articles.
