            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                Rust ensures that there are no null pointers, dangling pointers, or data races, unlike C / C++. Moreover, you can not access elements outside of array in Rust.

            <FeatureTitle class="FeatureTitle">Borrow Checker</FeatureTitle>
            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                Borrow checker is one of the key features of Rust. Its concept is similar to reference counters. It helps to prevent data races and memory leaks. It is implemented by default in Rust for default ADT like Vectors, Dequeue etc.

            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                Rust uses LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, which is also used by C compilers (GCC), C++ compilers, Swift, Python, etc. which helps to optimize the code and provide enhanced security.
