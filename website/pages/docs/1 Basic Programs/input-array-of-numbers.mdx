# Input Array of numbers
and a simple addition program for Competitive Programming and more in Rust

## Introduction

For many applications, including Competitive Programming, it is frequently required to take an array of space separated numbers from a user as string and covert it to an Array / Vector of numbers or any desired type.

So, it is better to make a function and just call it instead of rewriting it again and again. It should be **included in your template**, if you are doing Competitive Programming in Rust.


## What are we doing

In Rust, and most other programming languages, **input is taken as string of characters**. So, if it is written as an array of space separated strings, it is still a string in rust.

We want to separate the numbers and store them in an array or a vector.

## Addition Program

So, let's start with designing an addition program. In this program, user can input any number of integers in a single line and output will be sum the sum of all number.

**Example :** <br />
**Input :**
> 123  234 345 456 567

**Expected Output :**
> 1725

### 1. Declare the function and string

You can replace `usize` with any data type you want, provide it can be parsed.

```rust
fn take_vector() -> Vec<usize> {
    // Take the string input

    let mut input = String::new();
}
```

### 2. Take Input into string

Now,  to obtain user input, we need to bring the **`io`** input/output library into scope. This is present in standard library, called **`std`**

```rust
use std::io;
```

Now, we read and store input in **`input`** string  we created earlier.

``` rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut input)
    .unwrap();
```
**`unwrap()`** specifies that program will panic if, somehow, string cannot be read

### 3. Converting String into a array

Now, we will convert the string into the array of numbers **using map method**

```rust
let arr: Vec<usize> = input
    .trim()
    .split_whitespace()
    .map(|x| x.parse().unwrap())
    .collect();

// Return the array
return arr;
```

**`.trim()`** is used to trim any leading or trailing whitespaces. <br />
**`.split_whitespace()`** is used to split the string, on each whitespace. <br />
**`.map(|x|)`** is used to perform operation on each part of string, that we made using above function. Each part is represented as x<br />
**`.parse()`** is used to convert the string to number. Interestingly, you don't have to tell the data type in this case, because Rust automatically determines it using return data type. Cool, no? <br />
**`unwrap()`** specifies that program will panic if, string can not be converted to number. For example if you input `12h`, `23 34` it will panic because it is not convertible to number. You must enter 1 number per line.

### 4. Putting things together

```rust
use std::io;

fn take_vector() -> Vec<usize> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let arr: Vec<usize> = input.trim().split_whitespace()
        .map(|x| x.parse().unwrap()).collect();
    return arr;
}
```

### 5. Program With driver code

```rust
use std::io;

fn take_vector() -> Vec<usize> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let arr: Vec<usize> = input.trim().split_whitespace()
        .map(|x| x.parse().unwrap()).collect();
    return arr;
}

// Driver Code

fn main(){
    let arr = take_vector();
    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in 0..arr.len(){
        sum+=arr[i];
    }
    println!("{}", sum);
}
```

**Input :**
> 123  234 345 456 567

**Expected Output :**
> 1725

## Conclusion

In this article, we designed a function that take an array of space separated numbers from a user as string and covert it to an Array / Vector of numbers or any desired type.

Here is the function to summarize and copy and use purposes

```rust
use std::io;

fn take_vector() -> Vec<usize> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let arr: Vec<usize> = input.trim().split_whitespace()
        .map(|x| x.parse().unwrap()).collect();
    return arr;
}
```

**Note :** We can change the data type of number returned by replacing **`usize`** in above function with desired data type.

We also designed a simple addition program, in which user can input any number of integers in a single line and output will be sum the sum of all number.

In my humble opinion, if you are doing competitive programming in rust, you should **include this function in your template** for quick access.
