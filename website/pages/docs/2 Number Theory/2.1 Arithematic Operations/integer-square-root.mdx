# Integer ( Floor ) square root
of a whole number and program to find it in Rust Language

## Introduction

Many times, we have to compute the **floor value of square root** of a given number.

You may argue that we can find the square root of a number using default `sqrt()` method, and then take its floor.

But, there is a catch. F64 type uses some bits to represent the decimal number. So, it reduces the accuracy of square roots of numbers greater than 10<sup>14</sup>.

So, if you have to find a floor of square root of. say, 10<sup>18</sup>, you will simply get inaccurate answers.
This is a frequent cause of failing testcases in many questions, especially if 10 test cases are passing, and 11th gives wrong answer in solution involving square root of number `>= 10<sup>15</sup>.`, this might be the issue.

So, in this article, we will see how to find **Floor of square root** of a number in Logarithmic time complexity using binary search in Rust Language.

## Naive approach

Naive Approach would be to linearly check each and every number from 1 till we find a number whose square root is greater than the given number.

This will take **O( sqrt(n) )** time complexity. Function using this approach is

```rust
fn square_root(num:usize) -> usize{
    let mut i = 0;

    // If the number is 0 or 1,
    if num <=1 {
        return num;
    }

    // Increase i, till square of i+1 is less than or equal to number
    while (i+1)*(i+1) <= num {
        i+=1;
    }
    return i;
}
```

Program With driver code

```rust

fn square_root(num:usize) -> usize{
    let mut i = 0;

    // If the number is 0 or 1,
    if num <=1 {
        return num;
    }

    // Increase i, till square of i+1 is less than or equal to number
    while (i+1)*(i+1) <= num {
        i+=1;
    }
    return i;
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", square_root(899));
    println!("{}", square_root(900));
    println!("{}", square_root(901));
}
```

**Output**

**Time Complexity : O( n )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**
