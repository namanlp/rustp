# Integer ( Floor ) square root
of a whole number and program to find it in Rust Language

## Introduction

Many times, we have to compute the **floor value of square root** of a given number.

You may argue that we can find the square root of a number using default `sqrt()` method, and then take its floor.

But, there is a catch. F64 type uses some bits to represent the decimal number. So, it reduces the accuracy of square roots of numbers greater than 10<sup>14</sup>.

So, if you have to find a floor of square root of. say, 10<sup>18</sup>, you will simply get inaccurate answers.
This is a frequent cause of failing testcases in many questions, especially if 10 test cases are passing, and 11th gives wrong answer in solution involving square root of number `>= 10<sup>15</sup>.`, this might be the issue.

So, in this article, we will see how to find **Floor of square root** of a number in Logarithmic time complexity using binary search in Rust Language.

## Naive approach

Naive Approach would be to linearly check each and every number from 1 till we find a number whose square root is greater than the given number.

This will take **O( sqrt(n) )** time complexity. Function using this approach is

```rust
fn square_root(num:usize) -> usize{
    let mut i = 0;

    // If the number is 0 or 1,
    if num <=1 {
        return num;
    }

    // Increase i, till square of i+1 is less than or equal to number
    while (i+1)*(i+1) <= num {
        i+=1;
    }
    return i;
}
```

Program With driver code

```rust

fn square_root(num:usize) -> usize{
    let mut i = 0;

    // If the number is 0 or 1,
    if num <=1 {
        return num;
    }

    // Increase i, till square of i+1 is less than or equal to number
    while (i+1)*(i+1) <= num {
        i+=1;
    }
    return i;
}

// Driver Code

fn main() {
    println!("{}", square_root(899));
    println!("{}", square_root(900));
    println!("{}", square_root(901));
}
```

**Output**

> 29 <br/>
30 <br/>
30

**Time Complexity : O( n )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**


## Efficient Binary Search Approach

We can optimize the above approach using binary search, and find the integer square root in  **Logarithmic time** instead of Linear time.

Below algorithm can find the integer square root of numbers upto **10<sup>18</sup>** in logarithmic time complexity.

### Algorithm

1. If the number is 0 or 1, return that number.
2. Take starting point ( or low ) to be 1 and ending point ( or high ) to be 1.1×10<sup>9</sup> .
3. Find the mid-point of high and low. If mid×mid is equal to the number, return the mid.
4. If mid is less than the number, store the value of the mid, and set the low to mid+1.
5. Else, Set the high to mid -1.
6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 till high is not equal to low.
7. If high is equal to low, return the stored value of mid in step 4.

**Note :** I have taken 1.1×10<sup>9</sup> as high because it can find the square root of all the numbers upto  **10<sup>18</sup>**, without **overflowing.**

### Function

Here is the function using above algorithm

```rust

fn square_root(num:usize) -> usize{

    // If number is less than or equal to 1, return it
    if num<=1 { return num }

    // Take high and low, mid and ans .
    let mut low : usize = 1;
    let mut high : usize = 1_100_000_000;

    let mut mid;
    let mut ans = 0;


    while high>=low {
        mid = (high+low)/2;
        let mid_square = mid*mid;

        // If mid_square if equal to number, return mid
        if mid_square == num { return mid }

        // If mid_square is less than number, set ans to mid
        // And low to mid+1
        // Else, set high to mid -1
        if mid_square < num {
            ans = mid;
            low = mid+1;
        }else {
            high = mid-1;
        }
    }

    // In case the given number is not a prefect square,
    // Return stored ans, because it is floor of square root.
    return ans;
}
```

Use the same driver code.

**Output**

> 29 <br/>
30 <br/>
30

**Time Complexity : O( log( n ) )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**
