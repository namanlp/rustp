# Integer square root
of a whole number and program to find it in Rust Language

## Introduction

Many times, we have to compute the **floor value of square root** of a given number.

You may argue that we can find the square root of a number using default `sqrt()` method, and then take its floor.

But, there is a catch. F64 type uses some bits to represent the decimal number. So, it reduces the accuracy of square roots of numbers greater than 10<sup>14</sup>.

So, if you have to find a floor of square root of. say, 10<sup>18</sup>, you will simply get inaccurate answers.
This is a frequent cause of failing testcases in many questions, especially if 10 test cases are passing, and 11th gives wrong answer in solution involving square root of number `>= 10<sup>15</sup>.`, this might be the issue.

So, in this article, we will see how to find **Floor of square root** of a number in Logarithmic time complexity in Rust Language.
