# Prime Factorization of a natural number
And a program in Rust to list all the prime factors of a natural number

## What is Prime Factorization of a number

Prime Factorization of a natural number is splitting the number into its factors, which are prime numbers. It can also be understood as writing a natural number as the product of prime numbers.

**For Example :**  100 = 2<sup>2</sup> Ã— 5<sup>2</sup>

import primeFactorization from "../../../../images/Number Theory/prime-factorization.webp"

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}} >
    <img src={primeFactorization} width="100%" alt="Prime Factorization of 720" />
</div>

## Approach
Using BTreeMap

1. While number is divisible by 2, add 2 to prime factors and divide the number by 2.
2. Now, number is odd number. So, start from 3, and go till square root of number,  perform the step 3.
3. While i divides number, simply add i to prime factors.
4. If the number, after loop, does not become 1, number that is left, itself is a prime number.

## Program

Program using above approach is given below :

```rust
pub fn prime_factorization(mut number:i128) -> BTreeMap<i128, i128> {
    let mut prime_factors: BTreeMap<i128, i128> = BTreeMap::new();

    // Step 1 : Divide by 2
    let mut freq:i128 = 0;

    // You can use number % 2 == 0 also,
    // but this method is much more efficient
    while number&1 == 0 {
        number >>=1;
        // Again, You can use number /= 2 also,
        // but this is much more efficient
        freq+=1;
    }

    if freq > 0 {
        prime_factors.insert(2, freq);
    }

    // Step 2 : start from 3, and go till square root of number
    let mut i = 3;
    while i*i <= number {

        // Step 3 : Check if i is factor of number
        if number%i==0 {
            freq = 0;
            while number%i==0 {
                number/=i;
                freq+=1;
            }
            prime_factors.insert(i, freq);
        }
        i+=2;
    }

    // Step 4 : Check if number become 1 or not
    if number > 1 {
        prime_factors.insert(number, 1);
    }

    return prime_factors;
}
```

Program With Driver Code

```rust
use std::collections::BTreeMap;
use std::io::stdin;

fn take_int() -> i128 {
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    input.trim().parse().unwrap()
}

// Magic starts here

pub fn prime_factorization(mut number:i128) -> BTreeMap<i128, i128> {
    let mut prime_factors: BTreeMap<i128, i128> = BTreeMap::new();

    // Step 1 : Divide by 2
    let mut freq:i128 = 0;

    // You can use number % 2 == 0 also,
    // but this method is much more efficient
    while number&1 == 0 {
        number >>=1;
        // Again, You can use number /= 2 also,
        // but this is much more efficient
        freq+=1;
    }

    if freq > 0 {
        prime_factors.insert(2, freq);
    }

    // Step 2 : start from 3, and go till square root of number
    let mut i = 3;
    while i*i <= number {

        // Step 3 : Check if i is factor of number
        if number%i==0 {
            freq = 0;
            while number%i==0 {
                number/=i;
                freq+=1;
            }
            prime_factors.insert(i, freq);
        }
        i+=2;
    }

    // Step 4 : Check if number become 1 or not
    if number > 1 {
        prime_factors.insert(number, 1);
    }

    return prime_factors;
}

// Driver Code Starts

pub fn main() {
    // Take input
    let number = take_int();

    // Call Our function
    let prime_factors = prime_factorization(number);

    // Print result
    for (key, value) in prime_factors {
        println!("{} appears {} time", key, value);
    }
}
```


**Input**

>720

**Output**

> 2 appears 4 time <br />
3 appears 2 time <br />
5 appears 1 time


**Time Complexity : O( sqrt(n) )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( log(n) )**

**Note :** We can print the number instead of storing into the BtreeMap, to reduce **Space Complexity to O(1)** but it is rarely useful. BTreeMap or vector of prime factors is far more useful in real applications, so I will demonstrate BTreeMap, instead of printing directly.

You can also modify the code to use *HashMap* or *Vector* or *BTreeSet* or *HashSet*, according to your requirement.

## Conclusion

Prime Factorization of a natural number is splitting the number into the product of prime numbers. It is used for various applications.

In this article, we made a function to generate all the prime factors of a number and store them with their respective exponents. Here is the function for easy access

```rust
pub fn prime_factorization(mut number:i128) -> BTreeMap<i128, i128> {
    let mut prime_factors: BTreeMap<i128, i128> = BTreeMap::new();
    let mut freq:i128 = 0;
    while number&1 == 0 {
        number>>=1;
        freq+=1;
    }
    if freq > 0 { prime_factors.insert(2, freq);}
    let mut i = 3;
    while i*i <= number {
        if number%i==0 {
            freq = 0;
            while number%i==0 {
                number/=i;
                freq+=1;
            }
            prime_factors.insert(i, freq);
        }
        i+=2;
    }
    if number > 1 {prime_factors.insert(number, 1);}

    return prime_factors;
}
```

Above program runs on O( sqrt (n) ) time complexity. We can also optimize the code using sieve method, which we will discuss later.
