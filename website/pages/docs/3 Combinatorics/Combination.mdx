# Combination
and program to find the Combination in Rust

## What is Combination

Combination is the number of ways in which we can **choose** some objects from the given set of objects.
In combination, the order in which things are arranged **do not** matter, unlike in permutation.

**For example :** The Combinations of word RUST of length 3 are 4 => RUS, RUT, RST, UST.

In this article, we will use standard reference : the number of total objects in the set are denoted by **n** and the number of items chosen at a time are denoted by **r**.

So, total number of ways of choosing *r* items from *n* items are represented as **<sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>**. It will also be written as **C(n, r)**
