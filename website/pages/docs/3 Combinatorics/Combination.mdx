## What is Combination

Combination is the number of ways in which we can **choose** some objects from the given set of objects.
In combination, the order in which things are arranged **do not** matter, unlike in permutation.

**For example :** The Combinations of word RUST of length 3 are 4 => RUS, RUT, RST, UST.
