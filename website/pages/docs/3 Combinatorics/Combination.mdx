# Combination
and program to find the Combination in Rust

## What is Combination

Combination is the number of ways in which we can **choose** some objects from the given set of objects.
In combination, the order in which things are arranged **do not** matter, unlike in permutation.

**For example :** The Combinations of word RUST of length 3 are 4 => RUS, RUT, RST, UST.

In this article, we will use standard reference : the number of total objects in the set are denoted by **n** and the number of items chosen at a time are denoted by **r**.

So, total number of ways of choosing *r* items from *n* items are represented as **<sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>**. It will also be written as **C(n, r)**

## Combination formulae

Here are some frequently used formulae for Combinations.

1. **<sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>** = n ! / ( (n-r)! × r! )
2. <sup>n</sup>C<sub>0</sub> + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>1</sub> + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub> ..... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub> = **2<sup>n</sup>**

## Program to find Combination

Now, let us write a program in Rust Language to find the number of permutations when we are given *n* distinct objects, and we can arrange *r* at a time.

```rust
fn combination(n: i128, r: i128) -> i128{
    // nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
    return factorial(n)/(factorial(r) * factorial(n-r));
}
```
With driver code

```rust

fn combination(n: i128, r: i128) -> i128{
    // nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
    return factorial(n)/(factorial(r) * factorial(n-r));
}

// Driver code

use std::io::stdin;
fn take_int() -> i128 {
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    return input.trim().parse().unwrap();
}
fn factorial(number : i128) -> i128{
    let mut factorial : i128 = 1;
    for i in 1..(number+1) { factorial*=i; }
    return factorial;
}

pub fn main() {
    let n = take_int();
    let r = take_int();
    println!("{}", combination(n, r));
}
```

**Input**

>6 <br />
4

**Output**

> 15

**Time Complexity : O( n )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**

## Conclusion

Combination is the number of ways in which we can **choose** some objects from the given set of objects.
In this article, we saw the frequently used formulae of combinations for given n and r and also made a program to find number of combinations in Rust.

Here is the function for easy access

```rust
fn combination(n: i128, r: i128) -> i128{
    return factorial(n)/(factorial(r) * factorial(n-r));
}

fn factorial(number : i128) -> i128{
    let mut factorial : i128 = 1;
    for i in 1..(number+1) { factorial*=i; }
    return factorial;
}

```
