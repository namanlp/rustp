# Permutation
and program to find the Permutation in Rust

## What is Permutation

Permutation is simply the number of ways in which things from a particular set of objects can be **chosen and arranged**. In permutation, the order in which things are arranged matters, unlike in combination.

**For example :** Permutation of word RUST are RSTU, RSUT, RTSU, RTUS ..... 24 ways

If you want to read more about what Permutation means, I would recommend you to read from any High School Mathematics book of your preference.

In this article, we will use standard reference : the number of total objects to be arranged are denoted by **n** and the number of items chosen at a time are denoted by **r**.

So, total number of ways of arranging *n* items taking *r* at a time is written **<sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub>**
