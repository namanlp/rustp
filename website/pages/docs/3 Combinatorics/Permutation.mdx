# Permutation
and program to find the Permutation in Rust

## What is Permutation

Permutation is the number of ways in which some of the objects from a given set can be **chosen and arranged**. In permutation, the order in which things are arranged also matters, unlike in combination.

**For example :** Permutation of word RUST are RSTU, RSUT, RTSU, RTUS ..... 24 ways

If you want to read more about what Permutation means, I would recommend you to read from any High School Mathematics book of your preference.

In this article, we will use standard reference : the number of total objects to be arranged are denoted by **n** and the number of items chosen at a time are denoted by **r**.

So, total number of ways of arranging *n* unique items taking *r* at a time is written **<sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub>**. It will also be written as **P(n, r)**

## Permutation formulae

### When all Objects are distinct

1. **When repetition is allowed :** If Repetition of an object is allowed, then we can simply write number of permutations = **n<sup>r</sup>**. We can calculate it using Exponent or Power function.

2. **When repetition is not allowed :** If Repetition of an object is not allowed, then permutations can be written as  **<sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub> = n! / (n-r)!** We can calculate it using [Factorial function](combinatorics/factorial-of-number/)

### When some objects are identical

3. **When repetition is allowed :** If Repetition of an object is allowed, then we can simply write number of permutations = **k<sup>r</sup>**, where k are total number of unique objects. We can calculate it using Exponent or Power function.
4. **When repetition is not allowed :** If repetition is not allowed, but there are *n<sub>1</sub>* identical objects of type 1, *n<sub>2</sub>* objects of type 2 ... *n<sub>k</sub>* objects of type k, then total permutations of all objects are

<center> n! / n<sub>1</sub>! × n<sub>2</sub>! × ... n<sub>k</sub>!  </center>

## Program to find Permutation

Now, let us write a program in Rust Language to find the number of permutations when we are given *n* distinct objects, and we can arrange *r* at a time.

```rust
fn permutation(n: i128, r: i128) -> i128{
    // nPr = n! / (n-r)!
    return factorial(n)/factorial(n-r);
}
```
With driver code

```rust

fn permutation(n: i128, r: i128) -> i128{
    // nPr = n! / (n-r)!
    return factorial(n)/factorial(n-r);
}

// Driver code

use std::io::stdin;
fn take_int() -> i128 {
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    return input.trim().parse().unwrap();
}
fn factorial(number : i128) -> i128{
    let mut factorial : i128 = 1;
    for i in 1..(number+1) { factorial*=i; }
    return factorial;
}

pub fn main() {
    let n = take_int();
    let r = take_int();
    println!("{}", permutation(n, r));
}
```

**Input**

>6 <br />
4

**Output**

> 360


**Time Complexity : O( n )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**

## Conclusion

Permutation is the number of ways in which some of the objects from a given set can be **chosen and arranged.**
In this article, we saw the formulae for calculating number of permutation for given n and r and also made a program to find number of permutations in Rust.

Here is the function for easy access

```rust
fn factorial(number : i128) -> i128{
    let mut factorial : i128 = 1;
    for i in 1..(number+1) { factorial*=i; }
    return factorial;
}

fn permutation(n: i128, r: i128) -> i128{
    return factorial(n)/factorial(n-r);
}

```
