## Introduction to Data Structures

Data Structures are an integral part of programming in any language. They are very important for storing, organizing, managing, analyzing and updating the data efficiently.

There are 2 Types of Data Structures :

**1. Linear Data Structures :** In this, the data is stored in sequential manner, that is 1 after another. There is at max 1 preceding and succeeding element in Linear data structures.
For example, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Strings etc.

**2. Non-Linear Data Structures :**
