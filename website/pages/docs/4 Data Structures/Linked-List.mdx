# Linked List
and built in methods for Linked List in standard crate in Rust

## Introduction

Linked List is an efficient way of storing the data, especially for implementing the Abstract Data Types (ADT) like Stack and Queue.

**Definition :** Linked List is a linear chain like data structure, in which each node contains the address or the pointer of the next node.

Linked List is **non-contiguous**, that is, in the linked lists, data is not stored in sequential memory addresses, unlike Arrays or Vectors.
