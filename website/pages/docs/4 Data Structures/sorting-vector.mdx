# Sorting Vector
and a part of it in Rust

## Introduction

Sorting is defined as putting the elements in the vector into an *order*. The order can be ascending or descending or can be decided using a comparison function.

Sorting is very useful in many applications because it can help in

1. Searching for a given value efficient.
2. Finding the median of the sequence.
3. Merging the sequences.
4. Determining k<sup>th</sup> largest and smallest elements
etc.

Hence, sorting is one of the most important algorithms.

But here, in this article, we will not discuss the algorithm itself. We will learn how to use functions provided in Rust's standard crate to sort the vector.

## sort() method

The **`sort()`** method is used to sort the whole array. It is **stable sorting** algorithm, inspired by [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)

**Note :** You can use it to sort a slice of array as well.

For Example
