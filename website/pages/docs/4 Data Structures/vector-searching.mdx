# Searching in a vector
and program for linear and binary search in a vector Rust

## Introduction

Searching is finding the index of an element in a collection of elements. Here, in this article, we will discuss how to search for a given element in a vector.

We can search for an element in a vector ar an array in 2 possible ways

1. **Linear Search :** In this, we traverse through whole vector till the element is found. Hence, it takes **O( n )** time complexity.
2. **Binary Search :** In this, we only check mid-points instead of checking the whole vector. Hence, it takes only **O( log(n) )** time complexity. Vector must be sorted for Binary Search.

## Linear Search

In the Linear Search, we traverse the whole vector, and check if the given element is equal to key. If the element is found, its index is returned.

As it traverses the whole array, it takes **O( n )** time complexity. 

Also, **order of array does not matter** for linear search. It is very simple to implement. Here is a simple function demonstrating Linear Search

```rust
fn search(vecky:&Vec<usize>, key:usize) -> usize{
    for i in 0..vecky.len() {
        if vecky[i] == key {
            return i;
        }
    }

    // If element is not found
    return vecky.len();
}
```

Program With driver code

```rust
fn search(vecky:&Vec<usize>, key:usize) -> usize{
    for i in 0..vecky.len() {
        if vecky[i] == key {
            return i;
        }
    }

    // If element is not found
    return vecky.len();
}

// Driver code

fn main() {
    let vecky = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("{}", search(&vecky, 4) );
    println!("{}", search(&vecky, 100) );
}
```

## Binary Search

In the Binary Search, we only check the midpoints of a **sorted list**. Each time, we have to search only in half of the list. Hence, its complexity is **O( log(n) )**
