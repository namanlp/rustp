# Maximum Subarray Sum
in an array using **Kadane’s Algorithm** in Rust

## Problem Statement

Given an array of numbers, say **arr[]**, containing both **positive and negative elements**, you have to find the largest sum of the subarray of **arr[]**.

Subarray is defined as **contiguous** part of the original array, containing one or more element. For example, for array [1, 2, 3], [1, 2] is subarray while [1, 3] is not.

We have to find the largest  sum of all the subarray present in the given arr[].

## Naive Approach

Naive or brute force approach is to find the sum of all the subarray and return the maximum of them. Function using this approach is

```rust
fn max_subarray_sum(arr : Vec<i128>) -> i128{

    // it is not initialized to 0 because array can be all negative elements.
    let mut max_sum = arr[0];

    // Traverse through all the subarray
    for i in 0..arr.len() {

        // We use from i+1 to N inclusive
        // Because j is ending range of the slice.
        for j in i+1..arr.len()+1 {

            // We find the sum of the subarray [i..j]
            let mut sum = 0;
            for k in i..j {
                sum+=arr[k];
            }

            // Now compare the sum of this subarray with the max_sum
            if max_sum < sum {
                max_sum = sum;
            }
        }
    }

    return max_sum;
}
```

With driver code

```rust
fn max_subarray_sum(arr : Vec<i128>) -> i128{

    // it is not initialized to 0 because array can be all negative elements.
    let mut max_sum = arr[0];

    // Traverse through all the subarray
    for i in 0..arr.len() {

        // We use from i+1 to N inclusive
        // Because j is ending range of the slice.
        for j in i+1..arr.len()+1 {

            // We find the sum of the subarray [i..j]
            let mut sum = 0;
            for k in i..j {
                sum+=arr[k];
            }

            // Now compare the sum of this subarray with the max_sum
            if max_sum < sum {
                max_sum = sum;
            }
        }
    }

    return max_sum;
}

// Driver Code

fn main() {
    let arr:Vec<i128> = vec![4, -5, 3, -2, 1, 5, -6, 3];
    println!("{}", max_subarray_sum(arr));
}

```

**Output**

> 7

**Time Complexity : O( n<sup>3</sup> )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**

## Efficient Kadane’s Algorithm

Using Kadane’s Algorithm, we can find Maximum Subarray Sum in **Linear time complexity** and constant space complexity.

### Observation

In Kadane’s Algorithm, we use a simple **Observation**, that if the sum of the elements upto a given element is negative, we can discard this sum.
For example, in array,

> [4, **-5**, 3, -2, 1, 5, -6, 3]

We can see that sum of subarray [4, -5] is negative. So, we can easily discard this, because it will only decrease the sum of the elements. We can not include 4 without including -5. So, it is better to drop this subarray.

But in the array

>[4, **-3**, 3, -2, 1, 5, -6, 3]

We can include the subarray [4, -3] because its sum is positive.

### Algorithm

1. Initialise max_sum to any element of arr[] and current_sum to 0.
2. Add the first element to the current_sum.
3. If current_sum  is greater than the max_sum, set max_sum to current sum.
4. If current sum is less than 0, set current_sum = 0.
5. Repeat step 2 to 5 for each element of the arr[] and return the max_sum.

Function using this approach is

```rust
fn max_subarray_sum(arr : Vec<i128>) -> i128{

    // max sum is not initialized to 0 because array can be all negative elements.
    let mut max_sum = arr[0];
    let mut current_sum = 0;


    for i in 0..arr.len() {
        // We add element to the current sum first
        // because we have to consider single element also
        current_sum+=arr[i];

        // If current sum is greater than max sum, it becomes max.
        if current_sum>max_sum {
            max_sum = current_sum;
        }

        // Discard the current sum if it is less than 0
        if current_sum < 0 {
            current_sum = 0;
        }
    }

    return max_sum;
}
```

Use the same driver code.


**Output**

> 7

**Time Complexity : O( n )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**
