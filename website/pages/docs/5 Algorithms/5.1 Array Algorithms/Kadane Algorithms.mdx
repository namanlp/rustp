# Maximum Subarray Sum
in an array using Kadane’s Algorithm in Rust

## Problem Statement

Given an array of numbers, say **arr[]**, containing both **positive and negative elements**, you have to find the subarray of **arr[]** with the largest sum.

Subarray is defined as **contiguous** part of the original array, containing one or more element. For example, for array [1, 2, 3], [1, 2] is subarray while [1, 3] is not.

We have to find the largest  sum of all the subarray present in the given arr[].
