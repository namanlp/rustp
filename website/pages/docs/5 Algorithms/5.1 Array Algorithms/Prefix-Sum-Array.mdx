# Prefix Sum Array
and their interesting properties along with implementation in Rust Language

## Introduction

Prefix Sum Array is widely used in Competitive Programming for reducing time complexity, generally in arrays or vectors.
Using Prefix Sum Array, we can perform Range Queries in **constant, or O(1)** time complexity.

In this article, we will discuss some interesting properties of prefix array, and see the code in Rust Language to build a prefix array.
