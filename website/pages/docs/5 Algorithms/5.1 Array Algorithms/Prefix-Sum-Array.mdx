# Prefix Sum Array
and their interesting properties along with implementation in Rust Language

## Introduction

Prefix Sum Array is widely used in Competitive Programming for reducing time complexity, generally in arrays or vectors.
Using Prefix Sum Array, we can perform Range Queries in **constant, or O(1)** time complexity.

In this article, we will discuss some interesting properties of prefix sum array, and see the code in Rust Language to build a prefix sum array.

**Definition :** Prefix sum array, `p` of an array `a` is defined such that every index of array `p`, contains sum of all elements of `a` upto that index.

Formally, for all 0<= i < N,

p[i] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2]... + a[i-1] + a[i]

### Interesting properties

1. i<sup>th</sup> element of prefix sum array = a[i]+p[i-1],  for all 1<= i < n
2. Prefix sum array of positive elements is **always sorted**, in ascending order.
