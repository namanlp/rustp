# Range Query in Segment Tree
and program to perform Range Query in a Segment Tree in Rust

## Introduction

I have already discussed the use cases as well as how to [Construct the  Segment Tree in Rust Language](/array-algorithms/construct-segment-tree/).
If you have not already read that article, please visit that before, because this is continuation of that article.

Here, we will actually perform Range Query on a segment tree to find output of a given subarray of an Array.
