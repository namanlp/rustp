# Range Query in Segment Tree
and program to perform Range Query in a Segment Tree in Rust

## Introduction

I have already discussed the use cases as well as how to [Construct the  Segment Tree in Rust Language](/array-algorithms/construct-segment-tree/).
If you have not already read that article, please visit that before, because this is continuation of that article.

Here, we will actually perform Range Query on a segment tree to find output of a given subarray of an Array.

## Approach

Now, if we look at our Segment Tree and Range Queries carefully, we can categorize them in one of 3 categories.

1. **No Overlap :** In this, the Range of our Query and Given Node does not contain any common element. So, we return identity element in this case.
2. **Total Overlap :** In this, all the elements of the **given node** are covered in the query. In this, we simply return the value of node.
3. **Partial Overlap :** In this, there exists some elements that are covered in a node, but not in the query. In this, we have to search in its children nodes recursively.

**For example :** If a node contains value from [2, 5] (inclusive)

1. **No Overlap :** Will contain range query such as [0, 1], [6, 7] etc.
2. **Total Overlap :** Will contain range query such [1, 7] , [2, 10] etc.
3. **Partial Overlap :** Will contain range query such [3, 7] , [2, 3] etc.

## Function

```rust
fn range_query(st:&Vec<usize>, nl:usize, nh:usize, ql:usize, qh:usize, pos : usize) -> usize{
    //nl, nh == node low and node high respectively
    // ql, qh == query low and query high respectively

    // No Overlap, identity element in product is 1
    if nh < ql || qh < nl {
        return 1;
    }

    // Total overlap, return element at given node
    if nh<= qh && nl>=ql {
        return st[pos]
    }

    let mid = (h+l)/2;
    return range_query(st, nl, mid, ql, qh, 2*pos + 1) * range_query(st, mid+1, nh, ql, qh, 2*pos + 1);
}
```

With driver code

```rust


fn range_query(st:&Vec<usize>, nl:usize, nh:usize, ql:usize, qh:usize, pos : usize) -> usize{
    //nl, nh == node low and node high respectively
    // ql, qh == query low and query high respectively

    // Total overlap, return element at given node
    if ql <= nl && qh>= nh {
        return st[pos];
    }

    // No Overlap, identity element in product is 1
    if nh < ql || qh < nl {
        return 1;
    }

    let mid = (nh+nl)/2;
    return range_query(st, nl, mid, ql, qh, pos*2 + 1) * range_query(st, mid+1, nh, ql, qh, pos*2 + 2);
}

// Construct the Segment Tree

fn cs(n:usize) ->usize{
    if n.count_ones() == 1 { return (n<<1)-1; }
    let k = 1<<(64 - n.leading_zeros());
    return (k<<1)-1;
}

fn cons_st(arr:&Vec<usize>) -> Vec<usize> {
    let n = arr.len();
    let s = cs(n);

    // This is set as 1 by default for product only
    let mut segment_tree = vec![1 as usize; s];
    cons_st_util(arr, &mut segment_tree, 0, n-1, 0);
    return segment_tree;
}

fn cons_st_util(arr:&Vec<usize>, tree:&mut Vec<usize>, l:usize, h:usize, pos:usize){
    if h<l { return; }
    if h == l { tree[pos] = arr[l];return; }
    let mid = (h+l)/2;
    cons_st_util(arr, tree, l, mid, pos*2+1);
    cons_st_util(arr, tree, mid+1, h, pos*2+2);

    // Here, you can change operation as per requirement
    // I am using product operator for reference
    tree[pos] = tree[pos*2+1]*tree[pos*2+2];
}

fn main() {
    let arr = vec![1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    let st = cons_st(&arr);

    // We have to use arr.len() -1 as nh because inclusive range

    // Prints product of first element
    println!("{}", range_query(&st, 0, arr.len()-1, 0, 0, 0));

    // Prints product of first 10 elements
    println!("{}", range_query(&st, 0, arr.len()-1, 0, 9, 0));

    // Prints product of elements 2 to 5 ( inclusive )
    // So, the answer would be product of 3, 4, 5, 6
    println!("{}", range_query(&st, 0, arr.len()-1, 2, 5, 0));

    // Prints product of elements 1 to 7 (inclusive), arr[1] = 2 and arr[7] = 8
    println!("{}", range_query(&st, 0, arr.len()-1, 1, 7, 0));
}

```

**Output**
>1  <br/>
3628800 <br/>
360 <br/>
40320 <br/>

If there are Q queries,

**Time Complexity : O( n + q*log(n) )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( n )**
