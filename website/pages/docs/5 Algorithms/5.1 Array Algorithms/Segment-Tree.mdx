# Introduction to Segment Tree
and program to create a segment tree in Rust

## Introduction

The Segment Tree is a commonly used tree like data structure that is used for **range based queries**.

By using the Segment Tree, we can reduce the time taken for each range query to **O(log n )**, that takes **O( n )** otherwise.

The example of range queries on a given array are :

1. Sum of integers in a given range.
2. Bitwise OR and AND of integers in given range.
3. Minimum and Maximum in a given range.

If you got any of these queries to perform in Logarithmic time, segment tree is a good option.
