# 0/1 Knapsack Problem
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language.

## Introduction

0/1 Knapsack Problem is also a classical Dynamic Programming problem. In this problem, you are a thief :D

So, in 0/1 knapsack problem, you are given a list of items, along with their weights and profits if you sell them. But you have a limited capacity knapsack, say **W**, that you can use to carry the items with you.

Also, you have whole items, that is, either you can take the item or leave it and you can take 1 item only once.

You have to tell the maximum profit you can earn by stealing the items.

**For Example**

Item Weight = [1, 4, 5, 7]

Profits = [3, 6, 9, 11]

And **W** = 11

Answer should be 18, ( Taking items weights [1, 4, 5])
