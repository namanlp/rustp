# 0/1 Knapsack Problem
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language.

## Introduction

0/1 Knapsack Problem is also a classical Dynamic Programming problem. In this problem, you are a thief :D

So, in 0/1 knapsack problem, you are given a list of items, along with their weights and profits if you sell them. But you have a limited capacity knapsack, say **W**, that you can use to carry the items with you.

Also, you have whole items, that is, either you can take the item or leave it and you can take 1 item only once.

You have to tell the maximum profit you can earn by stealing the items.

**For Example**

Item Weight = [1, 4, 5, 7]

Profits = [3, 6, 9, 11]

And **W** = 11

Answer should be 18, ( Taking items weights [1, 4, 5])

## Recursive Solution

The recursive solution is pretty simple. We can either include a given item in knapsack, or do not include it.

So, we simply check all the possibilities, and return the maximum profit that we can obtain. We use the given algorithm.

### Algorithm

1. If the remaining weight in knapsack is less than the weight of given item, we can not carry it. Hence, check the other items.
2. We first try to include the item in the knapsack, and check the profit of remaining items with remaining weights recursively.
3. Then we exclude the item and check profit of remaining items and weight recursively.
4. We return the maximum profit earned through both the methods as the answer.
