# Longest Common Subsequence ( LCS )
and program to find Longest Common Subsequence using Dynamic Programming in Rust.

## Introduction

Longest Common Subsequence is a classical Dynamic Programming problem, in which we have to find the length of longest common subsequence in the given strings.

Subsequence of a string is defined as a string, that is formed by removing 1 or more elements from the original string.

**For Example :** For the string "RUSTP", the strings "RUST", "RP", "R", "UP" etc. are subsequences, but the strings "PT", "Z", "TS"

So, we are given 2 strings, say `string1` and `string2` we have to find length of Longest Common Subsequence.

**For Example :** If `string1` = "abcdef" and `string2` = "acfbde", the longest common subsequence is "abde", so answer is 4.

**Note :** In Rust Language, the `String` is UTF-8 encoded by default, hence, indexing is not possible in `String` type. Hence, we use **`Vec<char>`** instead.
