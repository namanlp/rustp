# Longest Common Subsequence ( LCS )
and program to find Longest Common Subsequence using Dynamic Programming in Rust.

## Introduction

Longest Common Subsequence is a classical Dynamic Programming problem, in which we have to find the length of longest common subsequence in the given strings.

Subsequence of a string is defined as a string, that is formed by removing 1 or more elements from the original string.

**For Example :** For the string "RUSTP", the strings "RUST", "RP", "R", "UP" etc. are subsequences, but the strings "PT", "Z", "TS"

So, we are given 2 strings, say `string1` and `string2` we have to find length of Longest Common Subsequence.

**For Example :** If `string1` = "abcdef" and `string2` = "acfbde", the longest common subsequence is "abde", so answer is 4.

**Note :** In Rust Language, the `String` is UTF-8 encoded by default, hence, indexing is not possible in `String` type. Hence, we use **`Vec<char>`** instead.


## Recursive Solution

Before jumping into dynamic programming solution, we will first have a look at recursive solution.

### Algorithm

In recursive solution, we apply the given algorithm.

1. If the last character of both the string is same, we must include it to our solution and recursively find the LCS of remaining string.
2. Else, we first check by removing last character from first string and then the last character from second string, and return the maximum of both the cases.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 till either of string is empty.

### Function

Here is the function using above algorithm

```rust
fn longest_common_subsequence(string1:&Vec<char>, string2:&Vec<char>, n:usize, m:usize) -> usize {

    // If there is no character in any of the string, return 0
    if n==0 || m==0 {
        return 0;
    }

    // If last character of both strings is same, we include that in our lcs
    // Hence, we return 1 + lcs of remaining parts of both strings
    if string1[n-1] == string2[m-1] {
        return 1+longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2, n-1, m-1);
    }

    // Now, if the last character is not same, we check by removing 1 letter from each string
    // And return their max as answer
    return max( longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2, n-1, m),
                longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2, n, m-1));
}
```

With driver code

```rust
use std::cmp::max;
use std::io;

fn longest_common_subsequence(string1:&Vec<char>, string2:&Vec<char>, n:usize, m:usize) -> usize {

    // If there is no character in any of the string, return 0
    if n==0 || m==0 {
        return 0;
    }

    // If last character of both strings is same, we include that in our lcs
    // Hence, we return 1 + lcs of remaining parts of both strings
    if string1[n-1] == string2[m-1] {
        return 1+longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2, n-1, m-1);
    }

    // Now, if the last character is not same, we check by removing 1 letter from each string
    // And return their max as answer
    return max( longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2, n-1, m),
                longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2, n, m-1));
}
// Driver Code

// Take vector of characters
fn take_string() -> Vec<char> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let vec:Vec<char> = input.trim().chars().collect();
    return vec;
}

fn main() {

    // Input String
    let string1 = take_string();
    let string2 = take_string();

    // Print the length of longest common subsequence
    println!("Length of longest common subsequence is : {}",
             longest_common_subsequence(&string1, &string2, string1.len(), string2.len()));
}
```

**Input**

> abcdef <br />
acfbde

**Output**

> Length of longest common subsequence is : 4


**Time Complexity : O( 2<sup>m+n</sup> )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( m+n )**

( Space complexity includes recursive stack space )

## Overlapping Sub-problems

If we have a look carefully on recursive approach, we computed multiple LCS of multiple strings again and again.

For example, if we have to compute LCS of strings `abcdefghi` and `jklmnopqr`, the LCS of strings `abcd` and `jklm` is computed more than 1000 times, and takes hundreds of iterations each time.

So, we simply store the result for each sub-problem, and return it if it is already computed, hence preventing it computing again and again.

In the LCS problem, we take 2D matrix, such that matrix[i][j] contains the length of LCS of first `i` characters of string1 with first `j` characters of string2.

For example, if the string1 is `abcdef` and string 2 is `acfbde`, then matrix[3][4] will contain length of LCS of strings `abc` and `acfb`
