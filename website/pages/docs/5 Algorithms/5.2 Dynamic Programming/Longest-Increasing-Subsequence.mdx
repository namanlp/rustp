# Longest Increasing Subsequence
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using memoization and tabulation in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Longest Increasing Subsequence is another classical Dynamic Programming problem, in which we have to find the length of longest increasing subsequence in a given array.

Subsequence of an array is defined as an array, that is formed by removing 0 or more elements from the original array.

**For Example :** If array are [1, 5, 8, 2, 4, 5, 10], the longest increasing subsequence is [1, 2, 4, 5, 10].
