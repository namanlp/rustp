# Longest Increasing Subsequence
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using memoization and tabulation in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Longest Increasing Subsequence is another classical Dynamic Programming problem, in which we have to find the length of longest increasing subsequence in a given array.

Subsequence of an array is defined as an array, that is formed by removing 0 or more elements from the original array.

**For Example :** If array are [1, 5, 8, 2, 4, 5, 10], the longest increasing subsequence is [1, 2, 4, 5, 10].

## Recursive Solution

Recursive solution to this problem is pretty straightforward. At each step, you have 2 choices :

1. **Include the element :** Include the given element, only if the previous element is lesser.
2. **Exclude the element :** We can exclude it and include other elements.

And recursively call for next elements.
We have to take maximum of both the cases.

### Function

Here is the function using above algorithm
