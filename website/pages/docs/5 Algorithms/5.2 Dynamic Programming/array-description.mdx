# Array Description
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using memoization and tabulation in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Array Description is another Dynamic Programming Problem taken from CSES problem set. Here is <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1746"> Array Description Problem Link </a>

In this question you are given an array with missing values and some conditions. You have to determine the number of possible arrays following those conditions.

**Conditions are :**

1. Absolute difference between two adjacent values is at most 1.
2. Each element in the array must be in range 1 to m ().

You are given the value of n, m and the array, in which missing numbers are represented by `0`, and other numbers are between 1 and m.

You have to tell the number of possible arrays that follow the above conditions. Since the answer may be very large, you have to tell the answer modulo 10<sup>9 </sup>+7

**For Example :** If the array is [2, 1, 0] and the m is 100, the answer will be 2 as the arrays can be [2, 1, 1] and [2, 1, 2].

## Recursive Solution

In the solution to this problem, we apply an observation.

**Observation :** If the value of the last element of the array is fixed, say `x`,  there can be only three values of last second element, that is `x-1`, `x` and `x+1`. Similarly, we can count the cases of last third element and so on till we reach first element.

We can apply this observation to solve this problem.
