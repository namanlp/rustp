# Coin Change Problem
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language

## Introduction

Coin change is another classical Dynamic Programming problem.

In this problem, you are given coins of various denomination, and each coin has infinite supply.

You have to tell in how many ways you can form the given amount by using these coins any number of times.

**For Example :** If coins are [1, 2, 3] and the amount is 4, there are **4** ways to form the amount using the coins, that is,

* 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
* 4 = 1 + 1 + 2
* 4 = 1+3
* 4 = 2 + 2

Hence, the output should be **4**.


Similarly, if the coins are [1, 3] and the amount is 4, there are 2 ways only.


## Recursive Solution

Recursive solution to this problem is pretty straightforward. At each step, you have 2 choices :

1. **Exclude the given coin :** We can exclude the given coin and find the answer with the remaining coins. In this, we simply call recursion using same amount, but n-1 coins.
2. **Include the given coin :** We can include the coin and again call recursion by reducing amount, but on same number of coins, because we can include and exclude same coin again.

We have to take sum of both the cases.

If amount is 0, there is 1 way to form the amount, that is, not using any coin.

Also, if n is 0 and amount is not 0, we have to return 0, because there are no ways to make the amount in this way.
