# Coin Change Problem
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language

## Introduction

Coin change is another classical Dynamic Programming problem.

In this problem, you are given coins of various denomination, and each coin has infinite supply.

You have to tell in how many ways you can form the given amount by using these coins any number of times.

**For Example :** If coins are [1, 2, 3] and the amount is 4, there are **4** ways to form the amount using the coins, that is,

* 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
* 4 = 1 + 1 + 2
* 4 = 1+3
* 4 = 2 + 2

Hence, the output should be **4**.


Similarly, if the coins are [1, 3] and the amount is 4, there are 2 ways only.
