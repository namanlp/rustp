# Dice Combinations Problem
and Dynamic Programming Solution using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language.

## Introduction

The Dice Combinations is a very similar problem to to [Coin Change Problem](/dynamic-programming/coin-change/) , except that in this problem, the order of the selection also matters.

For example, in this problem, `1,2` and `2,1` is counted as different unlike Coin change problem.

So, in this problem, we have to find number of ways we can form a sum rolling dice any number of times.

**For Example :** If sum is 3, there are 4 ways to make it

* 1+1+1
* 1+2
* 2+1
* 3

Hence, the output should be **4**.


This problem has been taken from our beloved [CSES DP problem set. See Dice Combinations](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1633)

## Recursive Solution

In the Recursive Solution to this problem, we have to make an observation.

If we fix the first number that comes on the dice, we can calculate the number of ways by subtracting it from n and calculating recursively.

For example, if we have to find the number of ways for **n = 7**, then we can fix first roll as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and then calculate the answer recursively.
