# Edit Distance ( CSES ) Problem
and space optimized Dynamic Programming Solution using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Edit distance is another very commonly seen Dynamic Programming Problem and is very similar to [Longest Common Subsequence Problem](/dynamic-programming/longest-common-subsequence/).

In this problem, we have to determine minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

Now, the operations allowed are different for different websites or problems. We are solving [CSES Edit Distance](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1639) problem in this article.

In this problem, allowed operations are

1. Add one character to the string.
2. Remove one character from the string.
3. Replace one character in the string.

For example, strings are `ABC` and `XYA`. For this, answer should be **4**, because you have to remove B and C, and add X and Y.

## Observation

The observation tells us that either the last character of string matches, or does not matches.

**1. Last character of string is same :** Then, we do not have to change it. We can simply solve the answer for n-1 and m-1 length strings. It can be proved it is always optimal.
**2. Last character of string is not same :** Then we can perform either of 3 operations.

## Recursive Solution

Recursive solution to this problem should be pretty straightforward now.

### Algorithm

1. If either of string is empty, **return length of other string**. Because, you have to either add all the characters or remove all the characters, depending on which string is empty.
2. If the last character is same, simply return the function for strings of n-1 and m-1 length. This requires no operation.
3. Otherwise, return 1 + minimum of all three operations.


### Function

Here is the function using above algorithm

**Note :** In Rust Language, the `String` is UTF-8 encoded by default, hence, indexing is not possible in `String` type. Hence, we use **`Vec<char>`** instead.

```rust
fn edit_distance(str1:&Vec<char>, str2:&Vec<char>, n:usize, m:usize) -> usize{

    // If either of string is empty, return length of other string
    if n==0 || m==0 {
        return n+m;
    }

    // If the character is same, we don't have to change it
    // And skip the character
    if str1[n-1] == str2[m-1] {
        return edit_distance(str1, str2, n-1, m-1);
    }

    // Else, we check all the 3 possibilities,
    // Return minimum of them as answer

    return 1+ min(
        min(
        // 1. If we add character, we can skip this character from
        // string 2, because, string 1 and 2 has same last character now
        edit_distance(str1, str2, n, m-1),

        // 2. If we remove the character, we skip it from string 1
        edit_distance(str1, str2, n-1, m)),

        // 3. If we replace, both string 1 and 2 have same last character
        edit_distance(str1, str2, n-1, m-1)
    );
}
```

With driver code

```rust


fn edit_distance(str1:&Vec<char>, str2:&Vec<char>, n:usize, m:usize) -> usize{

    // If either of string is empty, return length of other string
    if n==0 || m==0 {
        return n+m;
    }

    // If the character is same, we don't have to change it
    // And skip the character
    if str1[n-1] == str2[m-1] {
        return edit_distance(str1, str2, n-1, m-1);
    }

    // Else, we check all the 3 possibilities,
    // Return minimum of them as answer

    return 1+ min(
        min(
        // 1. If we add character, we can skip this character from
        // string 2, because, string 1 and 2 has same last character now
        edit_distance(str1, str2, n, m-1),

        // 2. If we remove the character, we skip it from string 1
        edit_distance(str1, str2, n-1, m)),

        // 3. If we replace, both string 1 and 2 have same last character
        edit_distance(str1, str2, n-1, m-1)
    );
}


// Driver Code
use std::io::stdin;
use std::cmp::min;

fn take_string() -> Vec<char> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let vec:Vec<char> = input.trim().chars().collect();
    return vec;
}

fn main() {
    let str1 = take_string();
    let str2 = take_string();

    println!("{}", edit_distance(&str1, &str2, str1.len(), str2.len()));
}
```

**Input**

> ABC <br />
XYA

**Output**

> 4

**Time Complexity : O( 3<sup>m+n</sup> )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( m+n )**

( Space complexity includes recursive stack space )

## Overlapping Sub-problems

If we have a look carefully on recursive approach, we computed multiple results many times.

For example, if the strings are ABCDEFG and MNOPQRST, the result for substrings ABC and MNOP is computed hundreds of times, and take hundreds of recursions each time.
These are called overlapping sub-problems, because it is a sub-problem of actual problem and is overlapping in multiple recursions.

To prevent this, we can store the output and each result will be calculated only once.

In Edit Distance problem, we can create a dp matrix, and store each value by lengths of first and second string. That is, answer for ABC and MNOP will be stored at dp[3][4].

This is called memoization or Top-down Dynamic Programming.

## Memoization ( Top-down DP ) Method

In memoization method, we simply take a DP matrix, and store the computed result.

### Algorithm

1. First, take a dp matrix of size (n+1) Ã— (m+1) and set all elements to None.
2. If the now, if the value for given n and m is already stored, return it.
3. Else, calculate the value using recursion and store it in the matrix and return it.
