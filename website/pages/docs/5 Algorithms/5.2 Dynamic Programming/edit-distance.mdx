# Edit Distance ( CSES ) Problem
and space optimized Dynamic Programming Solution using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Edit distance is another very commonly seen Dynamic Programming Problem and is very similar to [Longest Common Subsequence Problem](/dynamic-programming/longest-common-subsequence/).

In this problem, we have to determine minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

Now, the operations allowed are different for different websites or problems. We are solving [CSES Edit Distance](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1639) problem in this article.

In this problem, allowed operations are

1. Add one character to the string.
2. Remove one character from the string.
3. Replace one character in the string.

For example, strings are `ABC` and `XYA`. For this, answer should be **4**, because you have to remove B and C, and add X and Y.

## Observation

The observation tells us that either the last character of string matches, or does not matches.

**1. Last character of string is same :** Then, we do not have to change it. We can simply solve the answer for n-1 and m-1 length strings. It can be proved it is always optimal.
**2. Last character of string is not same :** Then we can perform either of 3 operations.
