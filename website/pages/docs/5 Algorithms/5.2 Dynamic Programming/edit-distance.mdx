# Edit Distance ( CSES ) Problem
and space optimized Dynamic Programming Solution using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Edit distance is another very commonly seen Dynamic Programming Problem and is very similar to [Longest Common Subsequence Problem](/dynamic-programming/longest-common-subsequence/).

In this problem, we have to determine minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

Now, the operations allowed are different for different websites or problems. We are solving [CSES Edit Distance](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1639) problem in this article.

In this problem, allowed operations are

1. Add one character to the string.
2. Remove one character from the string.
3. Replace one character in the string.

For example, strings are `ABC` and `XYA`. For this, answer should be **4**
