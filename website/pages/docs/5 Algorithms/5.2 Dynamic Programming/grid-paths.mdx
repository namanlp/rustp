# Grid Paths Problem
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using memoization and tabulation in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Grid Paths is another Dynamic Problem based on grids.

In this problem, you are given a grid with traps / obstacles. You have to tell the number of unique paths to reach from top left to bottom right in the grid, **without stepping onto trap**.

You can only move in right and down directions.

This problem is taken from <a href = "https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1638" > CSES Problem Set </a>

In the grid, `.` denotes an empty cell, and `*` denotes a trap.

import gp from "../../../../images/Algorithms/grid-paths.webp"

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}} >
    <img src={gp} width="100%" alt="Grid Paths" />
</div>

Hence, the answer is **3**.
