# Minimum Coin Change Problem
and space optimized Dynamic Programming Solution using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Minimum Coin change is another classical Dynamic Programming problem and is very similar to [Coin Change Problem](/dynamic-programming/coin-change/).

In this problem, you are given coins of various denomination, and each coin has infinite supply.

You have to tell **Minimum number of coins** that you can use to make the exact amount.

**For Example :** If coins are [1, 3, 4] and the amount is 6, the answer should be **2**, because you can form the sum using coins [3, 3]

## Recursive Solution

Recursive solution to this problem is pretty straightforward. At each step, you have 2 choices :

1. **Exclude the given coin :** We can exclude the given coin and find the answer with the remaining coins. In this, we simply call recursion using same amount, but n-1 coins.
2. **Include the given coin :** We can include the coin and again call recursion by reducing amount, but on same number of coins, because we can include and exclude same coin again.

We have to take minimum of both the cases.

If amount is 0, we can form it using 0 coins.

Also, if n is 0 and amount is not 0, we can not make the money. Hence, return Infinite value. We will take 10<sup>10</sup> as our *infinite* value for this question.
