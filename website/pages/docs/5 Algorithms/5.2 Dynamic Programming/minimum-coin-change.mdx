# Minimum Coin Change Problem
and space optimized Dynamic Programming Solution using tabulation and memoization in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Minimum Coin change is another classical Dynamic Programming problem and is very similar to [Coin Change Problem](/dynamic-programming/coin-change/).

In this problem, you are given coins of various denomination, and each coin has infinite supply.

You have to tell **Minimum number of coins** that you can use to make the exact amount.

**For Example :** If coins are [1, 3, 4] and the amount is 6, the answer should be **2**, because you can form the sum using coins [3, 3]
