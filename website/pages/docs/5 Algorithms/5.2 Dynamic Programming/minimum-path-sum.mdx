# Minimum Path Sum
and Dynamic Programming Solution to it using memoization and tabulation in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Minimum Path Sum, also known as Minimum Cost Path, is a grid based Dynamic Programming problem.
In this problem, you are given a grid of positive numbers, and you have to tell the minimum sum of elements from top left corner to bottom right through any path,
but you can move only rightwards or downwards.


import minPS from "../../../../images/Algorithms/minimum-path-sum.webp"

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}} >
    <img src={minPS} width="100%" alt="Minimum Path Sum Grid" />
</div>

So, for above grid, answer is **22**


## Recursive Solution

In recursive solution, we start from the end, that is, bottom right cell, and take minimum of Minimum Path Sum of the cell upwards and leftwards to it.

So, we find the Minimum Path Sum of upward and leftward cell and return this after adding the cost of current cell.

### Algorithm

1. Base Case would be that, if the current grid has 1 column and 1 row, return value of current cell.
2. If current Grid has 1 row, we can traverse only leftwards. So, return cost of current cell + cost of Minimum Path Sum of the left cell.
3. Similarly, if the grid has only 1 column, return cost of current cell + cost of Minimum Path Sum of the upward cell.
4. Else, return the cost of current cell + minimum of Minimum Path Sum of the upward cell and leftward cell.
