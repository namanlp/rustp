# Adjacency Matrix
and program to represent Adjacency Matrix in Rust Language

## Introduction

An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a graph, which is a collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges.
In an adjacency matrix, each row and column of the matrix corresponds to a node in the graph, and the matrix's entries indicate whether there is an edge connecting the corresponding nodes.

There are two common ways to represent the presence or absence of edges in an adjacency matrix:

1. **Binary Adjacency Matrix :** In a binary adjacency matrix, each entry is either 1 or 0. 1 in the (i, j) position of the matrix indicates that there is an edge from node i to node j, while a 0 indicates no edge.

Example of a binary adjacency matrix for a simple graph with three nodes (A, B, C) and edges (A-B, B-C):
