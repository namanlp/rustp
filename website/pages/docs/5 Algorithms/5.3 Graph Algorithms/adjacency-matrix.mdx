# Adjacency Matrix
and program to represent Adjacency Matrix in Rust Language

## Introduction

An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a graph, which is a collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges.
In an adjacency matrix, each row and column of the matrix corresponds to a node in the graph, and the matrix's entries indicate whether there is an edge connecting the corresponding nodes.
