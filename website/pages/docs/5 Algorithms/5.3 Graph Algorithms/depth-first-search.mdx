# Depth First Search or DFS
and program to perform it in a graph in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Depth First Search or DFS is a graph traversal technique, in which we traverse the **deepest node first** from the source node, and then the rest of the nodes.

## Adjacency Matrix

Adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to define the graph. In this, vertices are represented as rows and columns, and the edge are represented as 1. If there is no edge, it is represented as 0.

**For Example :**

    A  B  C
A  0  1  1
B  1  0  0
C  1  0  0
