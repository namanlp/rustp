# Prime Numbers
and program to check if a number is Prime number or not in Rust.

## What are the Prime Numbers ?

Prime Numbers are the natural number greater than 1, that are divisible only by 1 and the number itself.

Alternatively, you can say that prime numbers are the natural numbers greater than 1 that have only 2 factors, that is 1 and the number itself.

Smallest Prime number is 2.

**For Example** : 19 is a prime number. It is only divisible by 1 and 19 itself.

## Properties of Prime Numbers

* All prime numbers except 2 are odd numbers. 2 is also the smallest prime number.
* 2 prime numbers are always co prime to each other, that is their GCD = 1.
* Every natural number greater than 1 can be expressed as product of powers of prime numbers, which is unique. See [Prime Factorization of a number](/number-theory/prime-factorization-of-a-number/)
* Every even natural number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
* [Fermat's little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_little_theorem), for any number n, and a prime number p,  <b> ( n<sup> p-1</sup> )  mod p = 1 </b>
* Every prime number greater than 3 can be written as 6n+1 or 6n-1, where n is any natural number.

## Check if a number is Prime

Let us now make a function to check if a given number is prime or not. We iterate through all the number from 2 to square root of number and check if it divides the number. If yes, return false.

Finally, return true because it not divisible by any number.

**Proof**

Let us suppose, that some number, N is not prime. So, we can write it as

N = A × B

and 1 < A ≤ B < N. So, A must be less than or equal to square root of N, else A × B will become greater than N, because A × A > N and A ≤ B \=> A × B > N.

Hence, we have to check for the numbers only upto sqrt( N ).

### Program

```rust

fn check_prime(n:usize) -> bool{

    // Iterate from i = 2 to sqrt ( n )
    let mut i:usize = 2;
    while i*i<=n {
        // Return false if the number is divisible
        if n%i == 0 {
            return false;
        }
        i+=1;
    }

    // Return true finally
    return true;
}
```

with Driver code

```rust
use std::io::stdin;

fn take_int() -> usize {
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    return input.trim().parse().unwrap();
}

fn check_prime(n:usize) -> bool{

    // Iterate from i = 2 to sqrt ( n )
    let mut i:usize = 2;
    while i*i<=n {
        // Return false if the number is divisible
        if n%i == 0 {
            return false;
        }
        i+=1;
    }

    // Return true finally
    return true;
}

pub fn main() {
    // Take the number from user
    let n = take_int();

    // Output on the basis of if the number is prime or not

    if check_prime(n) {
        println!("Yes, given number is a prime number");
    }
    else {
        println!("No, given number is not a prime number");
    }
}
```

**Input**

>1000000007

**Output**

> Yes, given number is a prime number

**Time Complexity : O( sqrt ( N ) )** <br/>
**Space Complexity : O( 1 )**
