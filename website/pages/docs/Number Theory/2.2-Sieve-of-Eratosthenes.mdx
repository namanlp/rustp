# Sieve of Eratosthenes
and program to find all the prime numbers upto a given number in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient algorithm for finding all the prime numbers upto a given number.

It can print all the prime numbers upto a given number in **nearly linear time complexity** , O( N log(log( N ))) to be precise, and linear space complexity.

It also generates a complete list, which number upto N are primes and which are not. We can now check if a given number is prime or not in **constant time complexity !**

Sounds interesting? It is simple enough to understand also.
