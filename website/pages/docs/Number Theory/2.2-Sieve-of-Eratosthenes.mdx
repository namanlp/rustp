# Sieve of Eratosthenes
and program to find all the prime numbers upto a given number in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient algorithm for finding all the prime numbers upto a given number.

It can print all the prime numbers upto a given number in **nearly linear time complexity** , O( N log(log( N ))) to be precise, and linear space complexity.

It also generates a complete list, which number upto N are primes and which are not. We can now check if a given number is prime or not in **constant time complexity !**

Sounds interesting? It is simple enough to understand also.

## Algorithm

In Sieve of Eratosthenes, we will be storing if a number is prime or not at the index. So, to check if 5 is prime, we just have to check for value at array[5], if it is true or false.

1. Initially, take a boolean array / vector of size n+1 and set initially every element to true. Now, set 0 and 1 to false ( Obviously number 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. )
