# Sieve of Eratosthenes
and program to find all the prime numbers upto a given number in Rust Language.

## Introduction

Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient algorithm for finding all the prime numbers upto a given number.

It can print all the prime numbers upto a given number in **nearly linear time complexity** , O( N log(log( N ))) to be precise, and linear space complexity.

It also generates a complete list, which number upto N are primes and which are not. We can now check if a given number is prime or not in **constant time complexity !**

Sounds interesting? It is simple enough to understand also.

## Algorithm

In Sieve of Eratosthenes, we will be storing if a number is prime or not at the index. So, to check if 5 is prime, we just have to check for value at array[5], if it is true or false.

1. Initially, take a boolean array / vector of size n+1 and set initially every element to true. Now, set 0 and 1 to false ( Obviously number 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. )

</div>

2. Now, traverse from 2 to n, and if the number is marked as true, mark all its multiple as false. Because if obviously, a number is multiple of a number greater than or equal to 2, it is not prime.
Also, if a number is marked true, it must be prime because it was not marked as False by any smaller number. So, it is not a multiple of any smaller number, hence it is prime number.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}} >
    <img src={sieve2} width="100%" alt="Mark multiples of 2 as false" />
</div>

3. If any number, say x,  is marked as false, there is no need to traverse through its multiples, because the multiples of x will be already be marked as false by the least prime number that divides x.

4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for all numbers upto n

5. After traversing all the numbers, we are left with a boolean array / vector in which the i index is set true, if number is prime, and false otherwise.
