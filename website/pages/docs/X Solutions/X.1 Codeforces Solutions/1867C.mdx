# C. Salyg1n and the MEX Game
and solution of this problem with proof in Rust Language

## Introduction

In this article, we will see my solution to the codeforces problem, [1867C. Salyg1n and the MEX Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/1867/problem/C), which came in Codeforces Round 897 (Div. 2).

**This is an interactive problem!**

**Note :** My Solution might not be the most optimized one, but it is certainly working.

You can go to above link to view the question statement.

## Approach

In this problem, we can see that we can each time add a number, and a number less than that will be removed in next turn, until we add minimum number.

So, we have to add **the mex of the array** each time, till we reach the 0.

## Proof

Let us suppose to the contradiction that adding mex is not the optimal solution. This means that we can add `x` that can become mex, also there is an element `y` which is current mex.

Then, Bob can remove an element from the array, such that there are 2 elements less than `x` missing from the array.

As Alice can only add 1 element at a time, after which, 1 element will be removed from the array, so net change in elements less than `x` is at max 1.

Hence, we can say that there is always a missing element less than `x`, so mex will always be less than `x`.

But this contradicts our assumption.

Hence, we have to add mex each time.

Hence Proved.

## Implementation

We first find the mex of the array. Then we output it. Now, we take the input and print it, till -1, because the element removed will be new mex.

## Program

Program using above implementation is
