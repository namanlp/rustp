# C. Salyg1n and the MEX Game
and solution of this problem in Rust Language

## Introduction

In this article, we will see my solution to the codeforces problem, [1867C. Salyg1n and the MEX Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/1867/problem/C), which came in Codeforces Round 897 (Div. 2).

**This is an interactive problem!**

**Note :** My Solution might not be the most optimized one, but it is certainly working.

You can go to above link to view the question statement.

## Approach

In this problem, we can see that we can each time add a number, and a number less than that will be removed in next turn, until we add minimum number.

So, we have to add **the mex of the array** each time, till we reach the 0.
