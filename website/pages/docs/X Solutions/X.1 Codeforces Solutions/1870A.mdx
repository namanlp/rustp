# A. MEXanized Array
and solution of this problem with proof in Rust Language

## Introduction

In this article, we will see my solution to the codeforces problem, [1870A. MEXanized Array](https://codeforces.com/contest/1870/problem/A), which came in Codeforces Round 897 (Div. 2).

**Note :** My Solution might not be the most optimized one, but it is certainly working.

You can go to above link to view the question statement.

## Approach

In this problem, we can create a vector of integers, and push all the elements from 0 to mex-1. Then, we have to push maximum element, which is not mex.

Then, we check if all the conditions satisfy. If yes, we find the sum of the array and print it. Else, we print -1.
