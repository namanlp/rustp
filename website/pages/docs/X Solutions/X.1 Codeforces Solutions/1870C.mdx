# C. Colorful Table
and solution of this problem with proof in Rust Language

## Introduction

In this article, we will see my solution to the codeforces problem, [C. Colorful Table](https://codeforces.com/contest/1870/problem/C), which came in Codeforces CodeTON Round 6 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, Rated, Prizes!).

**Note :** My Solution might not be the most optimized one, but it is certainly working.

You can go to above link to view the question statement.

## Observation

**Observation 1 :** Clearly, if if b<sub>i,j</sub> = a<sub>i</sub>, then clearly b<sub>j,i</sub> = a<sub>i</sub> as well because min(x, y) = min(y, x).
**Conclusion 1 :** So, all the elements will form a **square**, because let us say, length is greater than width. Then, there must be some element, that is present in length, but not in width, which is not possible.
