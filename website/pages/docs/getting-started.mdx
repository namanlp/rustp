# Overview

Getting started with Smooth DOC.

<carbon-ad />

## What is Smooth DOC?

Smooth DOC is a ready-to-use [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/) theme to create a documentation website like this one. Creating a pro-quality website like this one takes weeks. Smooth DOC saves you lot of time and lets you focus on the content.

## Why I created it?

As the maintainer of large libraries such as [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/), [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/) or [xstyled](https://xstyled.dev/), I had to create lot of documentation websites.

I quickly created a system to be able to generate these many sites. At this time, Gatsby was still in boxes and other tools were not flexible enough for me.

Initially Smooth DOC was just a utility library to share common React components. Over the years, I added more and more features: Carbon Ads, React Live Editor, Dark Mode, SEO...

Converting it into a Gatsby theme made it very portable and reusable. After a big work of refactoring, Smooth DOC was born!

## What are the differences with other documentation generators?

Smooth DOC is opinionated, it generates a pro-quality documentation website with a minimal configuration.

It includes many features:

- MDX Support
- React Live Editor
- Full theme customization
- Dark mode support
- GitHub Links
- Social Image Sharing
- Carbon Ads support
- Netlify deployment
- Table of contents
- Built-in components
- Sitemap support
- ..and many other features!

All of these features make Smooth DOC the most advanced documentation system.

## Personalize options

Smooth DOC options are filled directly in `gatsby-config.js`. To make it yours, fill `name`, `description` and `siteUrl`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'smooth-doc',
      options: {
        // Name of your website
        name: 'Smooth DOC',
        // Description of your website
        description: 'Ready to use documentation theme for Gatsby.',
        // Production URL of your website
        siteUrl: 'https://smooth-doc.com',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```
