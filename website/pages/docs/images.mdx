# Logos

Learn how to change logos and social images.

<carbon-ad />

## Use your own logos

Logos are automatically loaded from `images` directory:

- `images/logo-manifest.png`: define the logo used in `manifest.json` and as `favicon`
- `images/logo-nav-light.{svg, png, jpg}`: header logo used in light color mode
- `images/logo-nav-dark.{svg, png, jpg}`: header logo used in dark color mode
- `images/logo-nav.{svg, png, jpg}`: logo used if light or dark logos are not found

Example of `images` directory structure:

```
images/
├── logo-manifest.png
├── logo-nav-dark.svg
└── logo-nav-light.svg
```

> It is better to use a ratio `1x1` for `logo-manifest.png` and horizontal one for other logos.

## Social sharing image

Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn sharing image are automatically generated by Smooth DOC.

The only thing you have to do is adding an image in `images/social.{jpg,png}`. The recommended size is 1280x640.
