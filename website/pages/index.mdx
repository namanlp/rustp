            <FeatureTitle class="FeatureTitle">Fast and memory efficient</FeatureTitle>
            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                The programs written in Rust are much faster and memory efficient as compared to other languages in general, as there are no runtime Garbage Collectors. Use of compiler instead of interpreter also boosts performance.

            <img className="feature-image" src={security} load = "lazy" alt="Memory safe" />
            <FeatureTitle class="FeatureTitle">Memory Safety</FeatureTitle>
            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                Rust ensures that there are no null pointers, dangling pointers, or data races, unlike C / C++. Moreover, you can not access elements outside of array in Rust. Rust also provides unsafe option for more flexibility.

            <FeatureTitle class="FeatureTitle">Borrow Checker</FeatureTitle>
            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                Borrow checker is one of the key features of Rust. Its concept is similar to reference counters. It helps to prevent data races and memory leaks. It is implemented by default in Rust for default ADT like Vectors, Dequeue etc.

            <FeatureTitle class="FeatureTitle">Use LLVM Compiler Infrastructure</FeatureTitle>
            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                Rust uses LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, which is also used by C compilers (GCC), C++ compilers, Swift, Python, etc. which helps to optimize the code and provide enhanced security.

            <FeatureTitle class="FeatureTitle">Low Level Programming support</FeatureTitle>
            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                Rust supports Low Level Programming and control over memory, like C and C++. Rust also allows the use of Pointers and References as well as executing Assembly Language Instructions and Embedded device support.

            <FeatureText className="feature-text">
                Rust is an Open Source Project supported by Mozilla Research. Its source code can by found at <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang" target="_blank">Rust's Github Repo </a> and is well documented as well.
